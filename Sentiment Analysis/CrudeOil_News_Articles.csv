How Russian Oil Is Making Its Way From Europe To Asia.html,"Russia has been ramping up oil exports to Asia since its invasion of Ukraine led to Western sanctions on imports of Russian oil. Some of the crude and products going to Asia are being transferred from one vessel to another in international waters around Europe, including outside UK territorial waters.  Off the coast of Suffolk in the UK, outside UK territorial waters, at least two ship-to-ship transfers took place in May, and UK-crewed boats helped the transfer and delivered supplies to the tankers, according to an investigation by Global Witness and The Independent.   The coast off Southwold, Suffolk, is designated an area of outstanding natural beauty, but it is also one of the few areas around the UK where ship-to-ship transfers are allowed, The Independent’s Ben Chapman notes.  The STS transfers of fuel oil off Suffolk identified by Global Witness and The Independent saw two tankers carrying 165,000 tons of Russian fuel oil worth over $201 million (£165 million) proceed to the Middle East and Singapore. These oil transfers are not illegal. Yet, such ship-to-ship (STS) transfers around Europe are being increasingly used for reloading Russian oil onto ships that then head to Asia via the Suez Canal, tanker-tracking publications have shown. There are other areas around Europe where STS transfers are happening, and new STS transfer “hubs” have started to emerge in recent months.  According to vessel tracking and analysis by Lloyd’s List, China-owned supertankers are at the center of a new STS transfer hub in the middle of the North Atlantic, around 860 nautical miles west of Portugal. Such operations in the area have never been seen before, Alex Glykas from maritime advisors Dynamarine told Lloyd’s List. 
 Russia is also redirecting its residual fuel oil (RFO) exports – the world’s largest such exports – away from the West and to Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, according to Roslan Khasawneh, a senior fuel oil analyst at the energy analytics firm Vortexa.  “Russia’s changing flows are establishing new transhipments hubs for Russian RFO including offshore Kalamata, Greece where there has been a spike in ship-to-ship transfers as well as in Egypt which has seen its imports of Russian fuel oil climb to a record 70kbd in June. As a result, Egypt’s fuel oil exports jumped to a 10-month high of 120kbd in June, mostly to Saudi Arabia,” Khasawneh wrote in an analysis in July.   Increased STS transfers help Russia move more and more of its oil volumes to Asia and its key buyers there, China and India. These moves are offsetting to a large extent the Western sanctions on Russia’s oil and the effect of the upcoming EU embargo on imports of seaborne Russian oil and products, expected to take effect at the end of the year.  Western sanctions have so far failed to crush Russia’s oil exports as Moscow is redirecting crude and products to its more than willing Asian buyers, China and India.   Related: Oil Dips Amid Renewed Demand Concerns
 Russian oil exports dropped by just 250,000 bpd in June, to 7.4 million bpd, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its monthly report for July. Despite volumes of crude and product exports being at the lowest since August 2021, Russia’s export revenues increased by $700 million month-over-month on higher oil prices, to $20.4 billion, or 40% above last year’s average, the IEA’s estimates showed.  European vessel owners, especially private Greek operators, are moving a lot of the Russian oil in the months before the EU ban on seaborne Russian oil imports kicks in. Greek tanker owners have increased their exposure to Russian oil shipping in the past months as they race to profit from the higher demand for heavily discounted Russian oil in China and India.  Russian exports of crude and products are yet to see a significant dent. Despite slightly lower volumes, so far, Putin is generating more money from oil than he did prior to the invasion of Ukraine or last year, as oil prices stay elevated.  The West’s main goal to cripple Putin’s revenue but still allow Russian oil exports somewhere in the world has led to the idea of capping the price of Russian oil. The G7 group of leading industrialized nations, led by the United States, is considering waiving the ban on insurance and all services enabling transportation of Russian oil if that oil is bought at or below a certain price.  "
Oil Dips Amid Renewed Demand Concerns.html,"Oil prices plunged by 4% at the start of August as the market digested weak economic figures from China, the world’s largest crude oil importer. As of 10:12 a.m. ET on Monday, WTI Crude prices were down by 4.49% at $94.22. WTI Crude started August on the decline, following the first back-to-back monthly losses in June and July since the end of 2020. Brent Crude, the international benchmark, was down to $100—after finishing July at the $103 a barrel handle, following a brief intra-day spike to $110 on Friday. Brent Crude traded down by 3.37% to $100.40 at 10:12 a.m. ET on Monday.   The market sentiment at the start of this month was one of concern about the pace of global oil demand after Chinese factory activity unexpectedly contracted, and its manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) improved only marginally in July and was well below expectations.
 PMI readings were also weaker in July than in June in the major Eurozone countries and in South Korea. In China, COVID flare-ups in July led to an unexpected contraction in factory activity, according to data from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics. Per the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI, the rate of improvement in China’s business conditions eased in July from a 13-month high in June and was only marginal.  
 Weak economic data from China rekindled fears about an economic slowdown in major economies and importers of crude, which could weigh on oil demand going forward. Later this week, traders and market analysts will be watching the OPEC+ monthly meeting on August 3, the first after the group decided to have all the 2020 cuts rolled back by the end of this month. “After gains last week, the focus in crude oil is shifting to the OPEC+ meeting this week where expectations for any notable increase in output for September are minimal. Supply side issues also continue to underpin but focus short-term has shifted to China’s manufacturing PMI miss and the resulting demand contraction,” Saxo Bank said on Monday."
US Crude Production Sinks In May.html,"U.S. field production of crude oil fell in May to an average of 11.595 million barrels per day (bpd), new data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Friday. That figure is down from 11.652 million bpd in April—a 57,000 bpd decline. May’s production figures are just 239,000 bpd above where they were at the same time last year, and 1.247 million bpd below pre-Covid levels. U.S. crude oil production fell in May in PADDs 1 and 3, and rose in PADDs 2, 4, and 5. The largest state gain by far was in North Dakota, which saw its production increase from 895,000 bpd to 1.049 million bpd in May. Texas, meanwhile, saw drops in production from 5.017 million bpd to 4.965 million bpd—a level that is even under those seen in December of last year, showing no production growth in Texas at all across those five months.
 New Mexico’s production dropped in May too, from 1.508 million bpd to 1.497 million bpd. The figures vary significantly from what the EIA had originally estimated for May. The EIA had previously estimated that U.S. crude production in May would rise to 11.74 million bpd. The Energy Information Administration estimated in its latest Short Term Energy Outlook that U.S. crude would average 11.91 million bpd this year, and 12.77 million bpd next year—a figure that if realized, would set a new record for U.S. production. 
 For June, the EIA estimated that production had risen to average 11.89 million bpd. With U.S. crude oil inventories down 6% from the five-year average, even with roughly a million barrels per day coming out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the news that U.S. production faltered in May and has failed to make any significant gains since last year contributed to Friday’s price increase, with WTI exceeding $100 per barrel, up more than 4% on the day."
Demand Destruction Could Help America Refill Its Oil Inventories.html,"U.S. petroleum inventories are still sitting at multi-year lows for this time of the year despite record releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), reports of weakening gasoline demand over the past weeks because of high prices, and a slowing economy.   Commercial crude and product stockpiles have failed to rebuild over the last few months, and the low levels point to continued tight markets for gasoline and diesel in the short term, potentially supportive of oil prices.   Yet, emphasis has been placed on a fall in U.S. gasoline demand in recent weeks after the national average price hit a record $5 a gallon in the middle of June. This, combined with fears of a recession, have weighed on WTI Crude prices. The U.S. benchmark hit this week its widest discount in over three years compared to the international Brent Crude benchmark.  This faltering demand for gasoline has weighed on WTI, while Brent prices reflect tight global physical supplies, buoyed by Russia's war on Ukraine and Western sanctions, as well as the European Union ban on Russian oil set to be implemented before the end of this year. The biggest discount of WTI to Brent in three years is driving a surge in U.S. crude oil exports, which hit a record high of 4.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in the reporting week to July 22.  The most recent data, however, shows that gasoline demand destruction isn't as clear-cut as it initially looked, with the four-week average gasoline demand still trending upward, according to EIA data. Despite signs of downward price pressures on WTI Crude, the lowest U.S. petroleum inventories in years—for some products in decades—are one strong bullish factor for oil prices, although it's not a given that it could outweigh market fears of recession.  In the latest reporting week to July 22, commercial crude oil inventories declined by 4.5 million barrels, the EIA data showed. At 422.1 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are about 6% below the average for this time of the year. In gasoline, inventories decreased by 3.3 million barrels last week and are about 4% below the five-year average for this time of the year. Distillates, which include diesel, have been the tightest market this year, with current stockpile levels 23% below the seasonal five-year average. 
 Distillate fuel oil inventories, which are most closely related to the economic cycle, are at the lowest for the time of year since 2000, according to data compiled by Reuters market analyst John Kemp. So far in the third quarter, distillate stockpiles have risen by less than 1 million barrels, an unusually low pace of inventory builds. This is one of the tiniest distillate inventory builds of the past four decades, Kemp notes.   Related: The Biggest Drivers In Global Steel Supply An economic slowdown could help rebalance those very low levels of distillate stocks, but the rebalance could need a deeper and longer downturn in activity, Kemp argues.  Indeed, the U.S. economy is slowing down. The advance estimate from the U.S. Department of Commerce showed on Thursday that GDP contracted by 0.9% in the second quarter, following a 1.6% decline in Q1. In theory, the GDP data met one common definition of a recession—two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction. But policymakers insist the 'technical' recession is not a broad-based recession because many areas in the economy are still going strong, especially the labor market, and external conditions pushing inflation higher are unique.  ""When you're creating almost 400,000 jobs a month, that is not a recession,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on NBC's Meet the Press last weekend, a few days before the GDP data was released. 
 Policymakers admit there is a slowdown, but the U.S. economy doesn't present broad-based signs of a recession.  ""I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession. And the reason is there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference this week after the Fed announced another 75-basis-point hike in key interest rates.  ""Really the growth was extraordinarily high last year, 5 and a half percent. We would have expected growth to slow. There's also more slowing going on now,"" Powell said, reiterating the Fed's goal of a ""soft landing.""  ""If you think about what a recession really is, it's a broad-based decline across many industries that sustain for more than a couple of months and there are a bunch of specific tests in it. And this just doesn't seem like that,"" the Fed Chair added.   "
NOCs Not Big Oil Are Responsible For Most Emissions.html,
More Oil Discoveries Boost Guyanas Offshore Boom.html,"The former British colony of Guyana, a nation whose economy was hit hard by the pandemic, has emerged as the world’s hottest offshore drilling location. Since 2015 global energy major ExxonMobil as well as its partners Hess Corporation and CNOOC have made a slew of quality oil discoveries in the offshore Stabroek Block which have delivered resources in excess of 11 billion barrels of oil. This is driving a massive economic boom for Guyana, which was among the poorest nations in Lain America and the Caribbean. According to the IMF, the micro-state’s gross domestic product grew by just under 20% during 2021 and is poised for further strong expansion. The substantial surge in oil prices which sees the international Brent benchmark up by 58% over the last year to be trading for $110 per barrel coupled with the push by big oil to decarbonize its operations are adding considerable momentum to the boom. Guyana’s government is expected to bank over $1 billion in oil revenues during 2022 which according to industry consultancy Rystad Energy will soar to $7.5 billion by the end of the decade. That will deliver a tremendous economic boom which will see Guyana’s economy grow fivefold over that period. Key to this tremendous economic opportunity is the rapid ramping up of crude oil production, with Exxon estimating that its operations will have the capacity to pump 1.2 million barrels per day by 2027, which is further oil discoveries. Exxon and its partners in the 6.6-million-acre Stabroek Block have made over 25 quality discoveries with the crude found being light and sweet with an API of 32 degrees and 0.58% sulfur content. The latest discoveries were at the Seabob and Kiru-Kiru wells in the Stabroek Block to the southeast of the Payara Project. Exxon also announced that production from the Liza oilfield in the Stabroek Block has exceeded the 340,000 barrels per day initially targeted. Earlier this month it was revealed that Exxon had lodged an application with Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency to drill 35 exploration and appraisal wells in the Stabroek Block. When the energy supermajor’s exploration success in the block is considered along with the five discoveries made in the Stabroek Block earlier this year, the drilling campaign will make additional discoveries boosting the 11 billion barrels already discovered. That crude oil is also economic to extract. Breakeven prices range from $35 per barrel Brent for Liza Phase 1, $25 a barrel for Liza Phase 2, which recently came online, and $32 per barrel for the 220,000-barrel capacity Payara Project, which is scheduled to start production during 2024.   
 While it is the Exxon-led consortium that is key to driving Guyana’s epic oil boom, which will see the Caribbean country become a leading oil producer, other international energy companies are also engaged in exploration drilling. British driller Tullow Oil, which is the operator of the world-class Jubilee field in offshore Guyana discovered in 2007, announced 37.5% partner Repsol, with TotalEnergies holding the remaining 25%, had spud the Beebei-Potaro well in the Kanuku Block. That wildcat well, which comes on the back of the 2020 Carapa medium oil discovery in the block where 13 feet of net oil pay was identified, is targeting a prospect that Repsol estimates contain around 200 million barrels of crude oil. The Kanuku Block lies below the southeastern tip of the Stabroek Block, where Exxon has made nearly all discoveries in offshore Guyana and is believed to lie on the same petroleum fairway. To the east of the Kanuku Block lies Block 58 offshore Suriname, where TotalEnergies and partner Apache have made five quality light oil discoveries with modelling estimating the block contains 6.5 billion barrels. Those factors, notably the slew of high-quality oil discoveries made by Exxon in the Southeastern tip of the Stabroek Block, bode well for further finds by Repsol and its partners in the Kanuku Block.  Related: U.S. Refiners Haven't Seen Fuel Demand Destruction
 Most of the crude oil found so far, in offshore Guyana, has been medium to light and relatively sweet, meaning it is cheaper and easier to refine into high-quality low contaminant fuels such as gasoline and diesel. That means, particularly in comparison to neighboring Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador which all predominantly pump heavy sour crude oil grades, the petroleum being produced in Guyana has a low carbon footprint. Those characteristics are especially important in a world where there are significant global efforts to significantly reduce carbon emissions while ratcheting up pollution restrictions and regulations. Disappointingly for Tullow, its exploration wells in the Orinduik Block, Jethro-1 and Joe-1, found high-sulfur content heavy crude oil, which compared to the light sweet crude being pumped by Exxon from the Stabroek Block is less economically viable. Guyana is a rapidly growing offshore drilling hotspot, accounting for nearly a fifth of discovered oil and natural gas resources globally and nearly a third of solely oil discoveries. The latest discoveries, made by Exxon and Repsol, coupled with growing light oil production will see Guyana become the third largest oil producer in Latin America after Brazil and then Mexico. That will deliver a tremendous economic windfall for the deeply impoverished South American nation which will grow with Georgetown focused on attracting greater energy investment and building urgently needed industry infrastructure."
US Refiners Havent Seen Fuel Demand Destruction.html,"U.S. refiners say there is no indication across their channels that America's fuel demand is weakening, contrary to recent data about gasoline consumption. The weekly inventory reports from the EIA at the beginning of July pointed to faltering demand after nationwide gasoline prices hit an average of $5 a gallon in the middle of June. During earnings calls this week, however, some of the largest U.S. refiners said they hadn't seen any signs of demand destruction.    ""Through our wholesale channel, there's really no indication of any demand destruction. In June, we actually set sales records. We sold 911,000 barrels a day in the month of June, which surpassed our previous record in August of '18 where we did 904,000 barrels a day,"" Gary Simmons, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Valero Energy, said on the conference call on Thursday.
 ""We read a lot about demand destruction, mobility data showing in that range of 3% to 5% demand destruction. Again, we're not seeing it in our system. We did see a bit of a lull in the first couple of weeks of July, but our seven-day averages now are back to kind of that June level, with gasoline at pre-pandemic levels and diesel continuing to trend above pre-pandemic levels,"" Simmons added. Tom Nimbley, chief executive at PBF Energy, said, ""We're at basically the same levels we've been for the last 90 days,"" commenting on demand on the company's earnings call. The latest reporting week in EIA data showed that gasoline demand increased from 8.52 million barrels per day (bpd) to 9.25 million bpd last week, AAA said on Thursday. While the national average gasoline price has dropped since Monday to $4.255 a gallon as of Friday, the rebounding demand and the latest decline in gasoline inventories ""could pressure pump prices and slow price decreases if the trend holds,"" AAA noted.
 According to data from fuel-savings app GasBuddy, Sunday-to-Wednesday U.S. gasoline demand was up 1.04% from last week, and was the highest of any Sunday-Wednesday period so far this year, exceeding the week ahead of July 4, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said on Thursday."
Big Oil Set For Blowout Performance But What Comes Next.html,"Earnings season is here with us once again, with 21% of S&P 500 companies having reported second-quarter 2022 earnings. According to FactSet data, 68% of S&P 500 companies have reported EPS above Wall Street estimates, while 65% have beat revenue expectations. The Energy sector is expected to be the best performer this earnings season, thanks to high oil and gas prices massively improving the balance sheets of energy companies. The sector is expected to post earnings growth of 265.3% Y/Y, far above the S&P 500's blended earnings growth rate of 4.8%.  At the sub-industry level, all five energy sub-industries are reporting (or are predicted to report) a year-over-year increase in earnings of more than 20% with Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing (1,087%), Integrated Oil & Gas (251%), and Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (216%) expected to post the strongest growth. Meanwhile, the energy sector's expected revenue growth clip of 55.9%Y/Y is also the highest of any sector, and way better than the S&P 500's blended growth rate of 10.9%. The energy sector is also beating Wall Street's revenue expectations by the biggest margin (+9%). But here's the main kicker: according to FactSet, companies that derive more than half of their revenues in foreign markets are soundly outperforming those with minimal international exposure. That's a great setup for the U.S. oil and gas industry because most American supermajors tick this box.  Indeed, oil and gas giants Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are expected to be the largest contributors to earnings growth and revenue growth for S&P 500 companies with more international revenue exposure.  Exxon Mobil generates 62% of revenues outside the U.S., while Chevron generates 56% of revenues outside the country. Their contribution to earnings for this category of companies is so large that FactSet says, ""…if they were excluded, the (blended) earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies that generate more than 50% of revenues outside the U.S. would fall to just 0.5% from 10.2%, while the (blended) revenue growth rate for S&P 500 companies that generate more than 50% of revenues outside the U.S. would fall to 9.1% from 14.6%."" Earnings so far from the European giants
 In a preview of what is to come on Friday on this side of the Atlantic, European oil and gas giants have broken all kinds of new records, with investors now awaiting some significant share buybacks and dividends.  Spanish Repsol reported earnings early Thursday, showing a 4X surge in net profit for Q2, along with a quadrupling of its net income and a doubling of first-half net profit, soundly beating analyst expectations.  Shell has also reported record Q2 adjusted earnings of $11.5 billion, up from $5.5 billion in the same quarter last year. That's even far above its Q1 earnings of $9.1 billion. Now, the London-based supermajor is planning another $6-billion share buyback because it's loaded with cash.   Related: Shell And TotalEnergies See Risk Of Higher Oil Prices TotalEnergies also just reported an impressive rise in net income, booking $5.7 billion for Q2–2.6 times higher than Q2 last year–and a doubling of cash flow to $16.3 billion.  Earnings Estimates A lineup of the hottest stocks on the planet are still to report in the coming days, with Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. scheduled to report on Friday, July 29th before the bell and Marathon Petroleum to report next week.  Exxon Mobil has seen its Wall Street consensus EPS revised to $3.84 from $3.03, which compares well with adjusted earnings of $1.10 a share in the second quarter of 2021. Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts, fund managers, company executives, buy-side analysts, academics, and others, is expecting an adjusted profit of $3.75 a share for Exxon. FactSet estimates Q2 2022 sales of $111.3 billion for Exxon, good for a 64% increase from $67.7 billion in the second quarter of 2021, while Estimize is expecting slightly less at $110 billion in revenue for the quarter.  A sizable revenue beat might see Exxon break its record for quarterly revenue when it posted $112 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Chevron has seen its Wall Street consensus EPS revised to $5.08 from $4.71, which also compares well with adjusted earnings of $1.71 a share in the second quarter of 2021, while Estimize calls for EPS of $5.09. FactSet estimates Q2 2022 sales of $58.7 billion for Chevron, good for a 56% increase from $37.6 billion in the second quarter of 2021, while Estimize calls for revenue of $58.5B.
 Analysts are eyeing Q2 earnings of $1.21/share for Marathon, which would mean an astounding 450% YoY increase, along with a 78% jump in revenues for Q2, compared to the same quarter a year ago.   The big question now is: What happens next? This multibillion-dollar boom–the second major quarterly victory for big oil–is happening against a backdrop of global turmoil that has seen oil prices fluctuate wildly.  ""When earnings are released, it's less about what happened backward looking than it is about forward looking stocks, or stories about the future,"" Leah Hartman, chair of finance, accounting and marketing at the University of New Haven, told the Houston Chronicle.   The word ""recession"" looms large here. Big earnings have shaken the markets out of their gloomy focus on recession, but it's still the elephant in the room.  For the second straight quarter, the U.S. economy has shrunk amid surging inflation and interest rate hikes, the latest 75-basis-point hike from the Fed hitting on Wednesday.  U.S. GDP contracted at a rate of 0.9% (seasonally adjusted, annual) for April-June, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on Thursday. It was the second straight decline, with the previous contraction at 1.6%. It's not a recession, but economists are worried about what happens by the middle of next year if growth continues to slow as inflation hits a 40-year high and the Fed continues on its aggressive rate-hike path. "
Shell And TotalEnergies See Risk Of Higher Oil Prices.html,"As oil companies begin to report their impressive Q2 results on the back of high oil prices, they are also offering premonitions of even higher oil prices on the back of the tight supply situation. Shell’s Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden told Bloomberg TV on Thursday that there is more upside than downside for crude oil prices. “Demand hasn’t fully recovered yet and supply is definitely tight.” Van Beurden added that he sees little room for more oil production from OPEC or U.S. shale producers—and the world oil supply could be even further curtailed as the full impact of Russia sanctions goes into effect later this year. When asked about how retail prices for oil and gas could be lowered, van Beurden responded, “We cannot perform miracles.”
 “Energy markets are tight,” van Beurden said, adding that supply would be constrained and markets tight for the rest of this year and well into next. The same general sentiment was touted by TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne, who said he saw room for oil demand to go higher, but not a lot of room for oil production to go higher. Both Shell and Total announced plans on Thursday to extend share buybacks on impressive results that doubled and nearly tripled Q2 2021 earnings, respectively. Shell reported that second-quarter earnings hit a new record of $11.472 billion, while Total reported a net income of $5.7 billion.
 The tight physical market has kept a floor under oil prices even in the face of a recession that could dent demand. That tight physical market is precisely what has emboldened TotalEnergies to forge ahead with some riskier projects in Mozambique and Uganda. The price of Brent crude oil has climbed to $107 per barrel—up $29 per barrel since the start of the year. The oil majors’ projections that oil prices could go still higher will not come as welcomed news to retail gasoline buyers or the Biden Administration, which has battled high gasoline prices since taking office."
Earnings Season Is Here And Energy Companies Are Booming.html,"Much to the chagrin of snowflakes everywhere, big oil and energy firms are slated to post a quarter of record profits in the coming weeks.  Thanks to the volatility in markets as a result of both Covid lockdowns and the conflict in Ukraine, the first six months of 2022 are slated to be the best on record for many energy majors and traders.  Names like Exxon, Vitol, Glencore, BP, Shell and TotalEnergies are all expected to report ""very strong returns"", according to a preview put together by Reuters this week.  One source told the news outlet: ""It is another record year. LNG outages will be a challenge to everyone and a big challenge to those who rely heavily on U.S. and Russian LNG."" Independent oil trader Gunvor Group and rival Trafigura have already reported record profits, the report says. 
 Another source told Reuters that ""BP did 70-80% better in the first quarter than last year, when trading returns were lackluster compared to a stellar 2020 and 2019"". The same source said that the company's trading division was ahead of its targets in Q2.  Both BP and Shell produced record results driven by trading in Q1. Sources also reported that Glencore's energy trading put up ""robust"" numbers in the first half of the year.  A banking source continued, telling Reuters: ""We are seeing similar across the sector with most reporting ongoing strong trading...the initial results year-to-date reflect ongoing record profitability.""  Related: Saudi Aramco May Hike Flagship Crude Prices To Record High Over Benchmarks Recall, we wrote just days ago that oil companies were warning about much higher prices for plenty of time to come. 
 Exxon's CEO said that global oil markets may remain tight for another three to five years largely because of a lack of investment since the pandemic began. Chief executive Darren Woods said it’ll take time for oil firms to “catch up” on the investments needed to ensure there’s enough supply. Woods was speaking at the Economic Forum in Qatar, which is among the world’s biggest exporters of liquefied natural gas and one of few nations that can substantially replace Russian gas supplies to Europe. Firms including ConocoPhillips are investing in a $29 billion project to boost Doha’s exports.  Several weeks ago it emerged that Exxon is also one of the bidders and Qatari Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi, speaking alongside Woods, said the US firm would get a stake. "
Saudi Arabias Real Production Capacity Is 15 Million Bpd Possible.html,"As the OPEC+ group prepares to roll back all production cuts by the end of next month, analysts and the market are searching for the answer to the million-dollar question shrouded in mystery: How much more oil can Saudi Arabia actually produce? And how much into spare capacity is the world’s top crude oil exporter willing to tap? Most analysts say that the UAE and Saudi Arabia are unlikely to tap much into their spare capacity regardless of the U.S. push for more oil. After all, a razor-thin global capacity cushion would make supply shocks even more shocking.  But the mystery surrounding Saudi Arabia’s actual oil capacity is just waiting to be unraveled–and has been for decades.  Following U.S. President Joe Biden’s trip to the Middle East, American officials expressed optimism that the Saudis and other Middle Eastern producers would take “a few more steps” to boost production. “There is additional spare capacity. There is room for increased production,” Amos Hochstein, the special presidential coordinator for international energy affairs, said on CBS’s Face the Nation on July 17, without elaborating. And going way back to 2005 when the specter of peak oil production was looming over the oil markets, Saudi Arabia itself assured the world that it could produce 15 million bpd for “decades”.  But the latest information coming out of Saudi Arabia is that it will not have additional capacity to increase production above the 13 million barrels per day (bpd) it has pledged to have by 2027, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said earlier this month. “The Kingdom will do its part in this regard, as it announced an increase in its production capacity to 13 million barrels per day, after which the Kingdom will not have any additional capacity to increase production,” the Crown Prince said at an Arab summit in Jeddah attended by President Biden. 
 One could argue that Saudi Arabia professed to be able to pump 15 million bpd way back when just to ease market fears–and perhaps more importantly, domestic fears–that global production and Saudi Aramco production were nearing the peak. It was important for Aramco to present itself to Riyadh as a capable market player. In 2008, Saudi Aramco had to defend itself against allegations that the oil crisis was caused by OPEC’s lack of spare capacity. It did so by claiming that it could boost its capacity to produce 12.5 million bpd by the end of 2009–a figure that is well above what it is producing now. Aramco also claimed that it could boost that capacity to 15 million bpd should the market need it, explains Wael Mahdi for Arab News this week.   Related: Japan Signs Its Most Expensive Coal Supply Deal Ever  And there were details, as Wael points out. Saudi Arabia’s then-oil minister Ali bin Ibrahim al-Naimi said at the time that Aramco could achieve this 15 million bpd by increasing the output at the Zuluf, Safaniyah, Berri, Khurais, and Shaybah fields by 900,000 bpd, 700,000 bpd, 300,000 bpd, 300,000 bpd, and 250,000 bpd respectively.  But Saudi Arabia later walked this back, arguing that it was just one proposed scenario, and not an actual solid program. The plans to increase Khurais and Shaybah were realized, but instead of boosting Saudi Arabia’s overall production, it merely went towards maintaining its 12 million bpd capacity. That leaves Zuluf and Safaniyah, which could get Saudi Arabia to 13 million bpd, accounting for declines in other fields. Saudi Arabia is now professing to have limited spare capacity of just 13 million bpd, although they are not even saying they have that now, they are saying that they could have it in the near future. Of the two seemingly disparate claims, this is the more likely scenario than believing that Aramco could increase its capacity to 15 million bpd.  Still, according to Mahdi, “the surface facilities of Aramco can allow it to produce up to 15 million barrels a day.” Of course, this doesn’t mean maximum sustained capacity to pump oil at that rate; rather, it references the capacity to potentially process such volumes not necessarily pumped in a single day. Mahdi believes that “the world can still expect to see more oil from Saudi Arabia above the nameplate capacity”.   Analyst estimates about OPEC’s spare capacity vary. According to the IEA, the EIA, and OPEC, the cartel’s spare production capacity is around 3 million bpd. Some analysts, however, believe that the cartel has no more than 1 million bpd of spare capacity available. 
 “Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ have very limited spare capacity, and they have to manage it carefully,” Ben Cahill, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Bloomberg just before President Biden’s visit to the Middle East. Per the OPEC+ deal, the Saudi oil production target is at 11.004 million bpd for August. The Kingdom has rarely reached this level, and not for a sustained period of time. So, it’s not certain that the Saudis have the ability to pump even 11 million bpd on a sustainable basis.  Related: Saudi Aramco May Hike Flagship Crude Prices To Record High Over Benchmarks It’s even less certain that the Kingdom could quickly tap—if it wanted to—the 12 million bpd production capacity it has claimed it has.  But Saudi Arabia could boost oil supply to the market by drawing on its own stockpiles and by slashing direct crude burn at domestic power plants, thus freeing more crude oil for exports. Industry sources have recently told Energy Intelligence that Saudi Arabia expects to have freed up to 1 million bpd of oil for exports by 2030 by cutting its direct oil use in power generation as it looks to replace petroleum liquids with gas-powered generation and renewables. The Kingdom currently generates 51% of its electricity from petroleum liquids and 49% from natural gas. By 2030, the Saudis plan on having renewables and gas generate 50% each of its power needs.  That’s for the long term. In the near term, Saudi Arabia is unlikely to tap too deeply into its spare capacity, considering that it’s pretty much one of the world’s last two holders of spare reserves that can be brought online within 30 days.  Even if dwindling, global spare capacity will be needed in the coming months as the world—despite fears of economic slowdown—hasn’t yet felt the full extent of the EU embargo on Russian oil, which kicks in at the end of this year.  "
G7 Presses Ahead With Russian Oil Price Cap.html,"The G7 are pressing on with their price cap on Russian oil, targeting a date of December 5 for having a mechanism in place to achieve this, an anonymous senior G7 official told Reuters on Wednesday. December 5 is also the date that the EU's ban on Russian seaborne crude oil imports goes into effect. ""The goal here is to align with the timing that the EU has already put in place. We want to make sure that the price cap mechanism goes into effect at the same time,"" the official said.
 A price cap on Russian oil purchases would theoretically impede the intake of Russia's oil revenues that are funding its invasion of Ukraine. The price cap plan the G7 has cooked up, however, is not without its challenges. For starters, the Group of Seven richest economies has not yet spelled out how such a plan would work, such as how to enforce such a price cap. To be successful, the plan would need broad support from all major Russian crude buyers, including India and China. More importantly, it would need Russia to go along with the price cap—something Russia said it would not do. Nevertheless, the G7 is still hoping that setting a price cap that is above Russia's production costs would incentivize Russia to go along.
 Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak already stated last week that Russia would not export oil to the market if the price cap was set below the cost of producing the oil. Just days after Novak's statement, Russia Central Bank head Elvira Nabiullina took it a step further: Russia would not sell oil to any country participating in any price cap, implying that even if the price cap were set above production costs, Russia would refuse to go along with the price cap plan by merely refusing to sell those countries any crude oil. Instead, Nabiullina said that Russia would sell oil only to the countries that don't enact a price cap."
Irans Oil Earnings Soar Despite Sanctions.html,"Iran’s oil industry seems to be going from strength to strength despite ongoing U.S. sanctions on Iranian energy, as governments worldwide look to secure their oil supplies in the face of global shortages and rising prices. Several heads of state have announced their intentions to increase the import of Iranian oil as Iran continues to boost production, largely ignoring U.S. sanctions, to ensure their energy supply. Considering Iran’s announcement that it saw a 580 percent increase in its oil and condensates income from March to July compared with the same period last year, it appears that U.S. sanctions are doing little to dissuade countries around the globe from purchasing Iranian energy. The country’s Minister of the Economy, Ehsan Khandouzi, stated: “Due to the increase in oil exports and our new budget's currency conversion rate, we saw a 580% increase in the treasury's income from the export of oil and condensate in the first four months of this year.”  Iran has been pumping oil funds back into its treasury with plans to rebuild its economy as its oil wealth increases. Nevertheless, the country is facing over 50 percent inflation, driving product and utility costs up. The Brent benchmark has increased from $76 per barrel this time last year to $104 per barrel now, meaning that Iran can be highly competitive with its oil prices to attract export partners while restoring its oil wealth.  In the face of energy insecurity, it seems that everyone wants some of Iran’s oil, with many state leaders deciding to ignore U.S. sanctions to import vital energy resources to maintain their reserves. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced this week that Turkey intends to boost its imports of both oil and gas from Iran following a meeting with President Ebrahim Raeisi in Tehran. Raeisi said that he hoped the two countries’ trade ties would triple in the coming years to reach $30 billion, following the meeting.  Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry of the Taliban stated last week that it had signed an agreement to decrease fuel prices, following a meeting in Iran to discuss oil purchases, and the price and transit of petroleum between the two states, as diesel increased by nearly 23 percent in June in Afghanistan. The Taliban intends to buy 350,000 tonnes of Iranian oil, starting this month. 
  Related: Battery Recycling: The Next Big Challenge For The EV Boom The most concerning of all of Iran’s oil trade allies is Russia. Vladamir Putin visited Tehran earlier this month for the second time since the Russian invasion of Ukraine following the signing of a $40 billion memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Russia’s state-owned Gazprom and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). This is just the latest news of cooperation between the two countries.  Gazprom will be supporting the NIOC’s $10 billion Kish and North Pars gas fields, which are expected to produce 10 million cubic meters of gas per day. The MoU also outlines plans to increase pressure in the South Pars gas field for $15 billion and for Gazprom to support several Iranian LNG projects including export pipeline construction. This move is expected to give Russia greater control over Iran’s gas exports.  And, of course, Iran is continuing to deepen ties with its fellow victim of U.S. sanctions Venezuela. Iran and Venezuela have been working hand-in-hand over the last year to circumvent sanctions on their oil and gas industries as they try to rebuild their economies. China has continued to support the partnership, buying energy from both powers by using alternative routes and ghost ships to transport sanctioned oil. Venezuela agreed to trade its oil for Iranian condensate, which was in short supply and is needed to dilute its heavy crude. The first delivery arrived in January, with 2 million barrels of condensate being shipped to Venezuela's Jose terminal. 
 And this month, Iran decided it would be increasing crude shipments to Venezuela to support the productivity of its aging refineries and allow for domestic oil exports. This follows a May agreement for the two powers to renovate Venezuela’s El Palito refinery. State-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) expects to receive 4 million barrels of Iranian crude this month, up from 1.07 million barrels in June. This aim is to help PDVSA rebuild the stock of its exportable grade crude, Merey, which is favored by Asian refiners.  With countries around the globe facing rising oil prices and the fear of energy shortages, due in part to new sanctions on Russia, many governments are putting their energy security above respect for U.S. sanctions. If Iran can maintain its competitive oil prices, it seems likely that it will continue to quickly rebuild its oil industry over the next year and beyond."
US Remains Worlds Top Oil Producer And Consumer.html,"Earlier this month BP released its Statistical Review of World Energy 2022. The Review provides a comprehensive picture of supply and demand for major energy sources on a country-level basis. Each year, I do a series of articles covering the Review’s findings. In the previous article, I discussed the trends in global carbon dioxide emissions. Today, I want to cover the production and consumption of petroleum. Oil Demand Bounces Back For 2020, the Review reported the largest decline in oil1 consumption on record. After nine consecutive years of increase, the Covid-19 pandemic caused global consumption of crude oil to decline by more than 9% in 2020. Last year oil consumption bounced back by climbing 6% — the fastest rise since 1976. However, consumption remains 3.7% below the record level of 2019.  The United States remains the world’s top oil consumer, averaging 18.7 million BPD in 2021. This marked an increase of 8.7% from 2020 (reflected by “Change” in the table below). This was the sharpest increase for any country in the Top 10, but it is still 9% below the all-time high U.S. oil consumption level of 2005 (20.5 million BPD).
 China was the second-highest consumer at 15.4 million BPD. Over the past decade, U.S. oil consumption has increased by an average annual rate of 0.4%, while China’s average annual increase was more than 10 times higher at 4.8%.  Related: Dramatic Heatwave Threatens Uzbekistan’s Electric Grid Germany was notably the only country in the Top 10 that saw a demand decline in 2021.  U.S. Remains Oil Production Champion
 Despite the ongoing impact the pandemic has had on U.S. oil production, the U.S. remained the world’s top oil producer in 2021 at 11.2 million BPD.2 Russia and Saudi Arabia retained their positions at #2 and #3. Although oil companies around the world did begin to increase production during 2021, average production for the year fell for 6 of the Top 10 countries. This was a major driver behind the global surge of oil prices in 2021.  Note that these production numbers are for crude oil and lease condensate. The U.S. also leads all countries in the production of natural gas liquids (NGLs), which partially end up in the oil products supply chain. If NGLs are included, the U.S. has an even larger lead over Russia and Saudi Arabia. Footnotes"
High Oil Prices Spark A New Wave Of Exploration.html,"When the energy crisis hit a nadir two years ago, highly indebted American oil and gas companies quickly changed their playbook, adopting stricter cost discipline, cutting back on expensive drilling programs, and vowing to return more cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Luckily for them, the good times are here again, with high oil and gas prices helping to massively improve their balance sheets. However, many shale companies have so far been reluctant to go back to their trigger-happy drilling days, preferring instead to fall back on their dwindling stocks of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) to keep going. Indeed, according to the  U.S. Energy Information Administration's latest Drilling Productivity Report, the United States' DUC tally plunged to 4,245 in June 2022, a sharp drop from 8,900 at its peak in 2019. The large decline in DUCs clearly shows that  U.S. oil companies are drilling much less, which does not bode well for revenue-starved oilfield services companies. It also does not help that oilfield services and drilling companies had some of the most high-risk debt during the crisis. But that could soon become a thing of the past if the latest announcement by OFS major Schlumberger Ltd (NYSE: SLB) is any indication. On Friday, the Houston, Texas-based company raised its full-year revenue guidance following a strong Q2, at which time it announced that ""growth was very broad across all dimensions."" Schlumberger says it now sees sales of ""at least"" $27B this year, good for an 18% increase from 2021, citing the biggest jump in demand for its services in more than a decade. Schlumberger says annual sales will rise the most in 11 years as energy security concerns outweigh recessionary fears among major oil explorers. ""Growth was broad-based, characterized by a favorable mix of exploration and offshore activity and the increasing impact of improved pricing, resulting in the largest sequential quarterly growth since 2010,"" CEO Olivier Le Peuch revealed during the company's earnings call. Schlumberger posted Q2 revenue growth of +42% to $1.53B in its North American market, while its international market recorded a +15% Y/Y expansion to $5.19B. Total revenue of $6.77B (+20.2% Y/Y) beat by $490M while GAAP EPS of $0.67 increased 86% sequentially and 123% year-on-year. Earlier, there were fears that OFS majors like Schlumberger, Halliburton (NYSE; HAL), and Baker Hughes (NASDAQ: BKR) would be among the first victims of the Ukraine crisis due to their sheer size and brand recognition. Indeed, Rystad Energy's head of energy services research Audun Martinsen told the Financial Times that their smaller peers were more likely to continue operating under the radar because they are not directly exploiting or exporting oil and natural resources. However, the latest set of results by SLB proves that these fears were unfounded.
 SLB stock has surged 8% after the announcement, bringing its year-to-date gains to 11.3%.  Source: The Financial Post  Source: Y-Charts Growing Production Schlumberger's robust growth is not an isolated case. Oil explorers across the globe are rapidly expanding the search for crude and natural gas on land and at sea. In the sector's most bullish forecast yet, Schlumberger compared the current era to the heady days of 2008 when oilfield contractors posted some of their best results in history thanks to high energy prices.

 ""We believe the accelerating international upcycle not only has multiple years to run, but will also unfold even if crude prices pull back modestly,"" Scott Gruber, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., has written in a note to clients.  According to James West, an analyst at Evercore ISI, on the global scene, oil companies are expected to grow spending by 22% this year to $450 billion, marking the fifth-biggest annual expansion since 1985. Even better for investors, OilField Services, MLPs, Oil & Gas Producers, and Midstream are all trading at considerable discounts to their 2014 highs.

Source: Nasdaq Drilling and well completions, along with pricing for those services, had been climbing higher, according to OFS companies, with oil workers also noting that job offers have been on the rise. Oilfield workers were some of the hardest hit demographic by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Nationally, the oil and gas industry is estimated to have lost 107,000 jobs as per global consulting firm Deloitte, with an estimated 200,000 roughnecks losing their jobs at the height of the global lockdowns. According to trade group Energy Workforce & Technology Council (Council), U.S. oilfield jobs have been increasing over the past year. Meanwhile, pricing power has been returning in niches like high-spec onshore drilling rigs, with day rates for such U.S. rigs steadily climbing."
Libya Raises Oil Production To 11 Million Bpd.html,"Libya, plagued by port blockades and protests at oil facilities in recent months, has now managed to raise its oil production to 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd), the oil minister of the Tripoli-based government said in a text message sent to Reuters on Tuesday. Libya’s oil production has recovered in recent days after the country resumed oil exports last week. Last Wednesday, the first tankers arrived in Libya to load oil for export, ending a force majeure on key oilfields and ports that had been in place since April. The force majeure has severely crippled Libya’s oil exports in recent months, following weeks of protests and closures amid the new rift in Libya’s political class over who should be governing the country.
 The most recent rivalry is between Fathi Bashaga, the Prime Minister appointed by Parliament earlier this year, and Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, who was appointed last year through a process backed by the United Nations. Dbeibah refuses to cede power. Bashaga, backed by the east-based Parliament, is now based in Sirte in the east of Libya, while Dbeibah is based in Tripoli. Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) also got a new chief, after Farhat Bengdara was appointed by Dbeibah last week to replace the long-term chairman of the state-oil firm, Mustafa Sanalla. The National Oil Corporation has said it plans to see oil output rates recover to 1.2 million bpd in less than a month.
 “The NOC is striving to increase production and bring it back to its normal rates of 1.2 million barrels per day in two weeks,” the company said last week after it announced production had jumped to 860,000 bpd after the force majeure on major export terminals was lifted.   Violence is still rife, however, which may interfere with these plans. The return of most of the Libyan oil—albeit far from certain that this time export rates would remain stable—is good news for the tight physical crude market globally amid altered crude flows following the sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine."
East African Governments Clash With Environmentalists Over New Oil Pipeline.html,"East Africa seems to be split in favour of and against the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) being built in Uganda and Tanzania. Environmentalists are concerned about the damage the pipeline and the development of an oil and gas industry could cause to the countries. But the governments of the East African states are hopeful about how the industry could support their economies, as oil majors look to Africa to develop new, low-carbon oil operations.  In 2015, French oil major Total (now TotalEnergies) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) agreed on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the two governments to develop a 1,443km-long pipeline for the transportation of oil from Uganda to Tanzania’s Port of Tanga for export.  Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni strongly supports the expansion of the country’s oil industry, seeing the resource as something that should be developed nationally to support the economy while the global demand is high. The $10 billion development includes the construction of EACOP, the Kingfisher Lake Albert project and Tilenga, the Murchison Falls project. One of the most controversial areas of the project is the planned construction of 10 well pads, a feeder pipeline, and a refinery in and around the Murchison Falls national park, with the potential to be the first oil project within a protected area in East Africa.  Uganda expects to have an output of 230,000 bpd of oil by 2025. The construction of the pipeline will make it easier to transport crude from Uganda to the non-oil-producing state of Tanzania, and for it to be exported to other countries. Ghana and the Democratic Republic of Congo are now looking to Uganda to see how it cultivates its oil sector to learn from in the development own energy industries.  Several political leaders in the region see the development of their oil and gas industries as a means toimprove energy security and support their national economies, to reduce poverty. In addition, after years of resource exploitation from foreign powers, many governments recognise the fleeting potential of oil exploration and production at the national level. Oil majors around the globe are now looking to expand their low-carbon oil operations into new regions that will support the longevity of their production, and it is Africa’s time to shine and profit. 
 Some suggest that the benefits of the construction of EACOP could be far-reaching, supporting the aim to bring an end to energy poverty in Africa by 2030, and encouraging job creation, local community empowerment, and wider socio-economic growth. The development of the two countries’ oil industries is expected to encourage a 60 percent increase in foreign direct investment and encourage development in other sectors.  The Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber (AEC), NJ Ayuk, explains “Ugandans and Tanzanians should not have to pay the price for western, developed nations. It makes no sense to oppose the construction of the pipeline. If EACOP fails, there will be no guarantee of employment, with a lot of the population remaining energy poor for years to come, and investment directed towards East African exploration will dry up. Africa does not deserve this. Africa deserves the rights to develop its resources and that includes the EACOP.” Targeting environmentalists, he also said, “Stop disrupting Africa's development and let's use the EACOP and every other oil and gas project on the continent to drive Africa into a new era of energy and economic success.”  Related: SEC Investigates Coinbase Over Securities Listings But not everyone agrees with this point of view. There are far-reaching environmental concerns around the development of not only EACOP but Uganda’s oil industry in general. NGOs worry that EACOP could lead to the displacement of thousands, destroy farmland, and devastate ecosystems across the region. In addition, there are fears of water contamination in the Lake Victoria Basin, which delivers water to over 40 million people. Further, the pipeline is expected to lead to the emissions of 34 million tonnes of CO2 annually, a seven-fold increase on Uganda’s current emissions.  
 The StopEacop movement, based in Nairobi, and supported by 260 civil society organizations, aims to raise awareness around the potential negative effects of the pipeline development. The group has successfully reached out to many potential funders of the project to dissuade them from investing in EACOP, including HSBC, BNP Paribas and Swiss Re and, most recently, Deutsche Bank. Environmentalists have attacked net-zero pledges made by many potential investors, pointing out that the development of EACOP would be contradictory to their climate promises and could therefore damage their reputation.  While politicians and other public figures support the development of EACOP, to support economic development across the East African region, thousands of environmentalists across the region and the world oppose the development due to climate concerns. But with ongoing worries around energy security, is pressure from NGOs and famous activists enough to stop the pipeline from going ahead?"
Traders Are Betting On The End Of The Oil Price Slump.html,
Gulf Producers Hike Crude Prices Despite Recession Fears.html,"In hindsight, June 2022 might go down as the last month when the markets at large were still yet to go into full panic, acknowledging economic recession as a necessity but not yet succumbing to a spiral of fear and agitation. The pricing of August-loading grades coming from the Middle East still reflects that feeling when China was still expected to finally come back from its lockdown-induced demand slump when the global shortage of supply still kept market fundamentals extremely tight. As we will see below, August 2022 will see many grades reach their highest-ever market differential. It is more than likely that even in the following month the seemingly incessant appreciation of crude will continue – just looking at futures curves right now, with front months being around $100 per barrel, indicates an even more distressing picture than before the crude sell-off. Yet the months following August will already have an additional psychological layer attached – everybody will be looking at signs and proofs of demand destruction taking place, making it difficult for Middle Eastern NOCs to be straightforwardly and unabashedly assertive with their prices.  Chart 1. Saudi Aramco’s Official Selling Prices for Asian Cargoes (vs Oman/Dubai average). Source: Saudi Aramco. Saudi Aramco lifted all its Asian formula prices for cargoes loading in August 2022, availing itself of steepening Dubai backwardation as the cash-to-futures spread moved up by another $2.30 per barrel. This put most Saudi grades close to the record highs we have seen in May, as could be seen with Arab Light, arguably the most important grade it markets, as the Saudi NOC priced it just below the $9.35 per barrel premium to Oman/Dubai. Despite the naphtha weakness coming from a continent-wide oversupply streak, the monthly hikes were even more marked for lighter grades - Arab Extra Light went up by $3.50 per barrel, making the $10.65 per barrel premium vs Oman/Dubai the highest since Aramco started issuing OSPs. Following reports that Saudi Aramco cut the July allocations of at least four Asian refiners, most of them located in China made sure that the upcoming month’s nominations were fully met.   Related: U.S. Oil Rig Count Unchanged As WTI Slumps Below $100 Chart 2. Saudi Aramco’s Official Selling Prices for Europe-bound cargoes (vs ICE Brent). Source: Saudi Aramco. Looking into Europe, Saudi Aramco opted for a clear delineation between heavy and light grades, just as it had done in Asia. The NW Europe differential for Arab Heavy, at a $2.6 per barrel discount to ICE Bwave, was simply rolled over from the previous month, whilst the lightest Saudi grade on offer, Arab Extra Light saw a $1.20 per barrel month-on-month hike to an $8 per barrel premium to Bwave. Apart from the overall tightness in European markets, stemming from the gradual shunning of Russian crude and products, the price increases must have also come from seeing Europe-bound June exports move to their highest monthly level in more than two years, at 750,000 b/d. As for Saudi exports in general, they have been declining for the second consecutive month. After the peak in April, they have lost more than 300,000 b/d in volume and dropped to 6.7 million b/d in June. Offsetting the decline in outright oil, exports in products have simultaneously increased, too, implying that Saudi Aramco refines more than previously thanks to Jizan, however the extent of product hikes so far lags the drop in crude.  Chart 3. ADNOC Official Selling Prices for July 2022 (set outright, here vs Oman/Dubai average).
 Source: ADNOC.  The UAE national oil company ADNOC set the August price of its benchmark light sweet grade Murban at $117.53 per barrel, up almost $8 per barrel compared to the previous month. For the first time since Murban started trading, its premium vs Dubai has moved above $2 per barrel, in fact, it soared to $4.7 per barrel in June. Whilst the market still values grades yielding a lot of light distillates, ADNOC’s medium sour grades such as Upper Zakum are still struggling – the latter’s differential to Murban dropped by another dollar, sinking to a $3.20 per barrel discount. In the meantime, ADNOC has been working to promote foreign investment into its oil and gas industry – with the Emirati company attracting some $65 billion already since 2016, the idea is still to attract as many partners as possible to ensure the fulfilment of the 5 million b/d production capacity target.  Chart 4. Iraqi Official Selling Prices for Asian cargoes (vs Oman/Dubai average). Source: SOMO. The Iraqi state oil marketer SOMO was toeing the line of Saudi Aramco in Asia, increasing its August formula prices by $1.20 and $0.55 per barrel for Basrah Medium and Basrah Heavy, respectively. In Europe, however, the Iraqi willingness to chart a separate course from Saudi Aramco is becoming ever more visible. Barring Arab Heavy, the Saudi NOC increased every single European formula price in August – in stark contrast to that, SOMO dropped all its OSPs. Whilst it should be mentioned, as usual, that SOMO is pricing its formula prices off Dated Brent, a spot market assessment issued by Platts, the contrary direction is nevertheless indicative of just how much the Iraqi state oil marketer wants to buck the trend of aggressive Saudi pricing. Basrah Heavy is a good example, with the August differential of Iraq’s heavy sour benchmark seeing another $1.75 per barrel decline to a $12.75 per barrel discount to Dated Brent, the steepest differential it has ever seen.  Chart 5. Iraqi Official Selling Prices for European cargoes (vs Brent Dated). Source: SOMO.  Iraq has been working towards expanding the export capacity of its southern ports and if one were to listen to its top federal officials, there would be a substantial increase in outflows starting from September. As things stand right now, the loading capacity of its Basrah port stands at 3.3 million b/d, to be more specific 1.1 million b/d for Basrah Heavy and 2.2 million b/d for Basrah Medium. The idea was to attain a 150,000 b/d increment by September, however, judging by recent SOMO utterances this has been revised to just 50,000 b/d. To a certain extent, the Iraqi federal authorities could play down the delays in project management, seeing the difficulties involved in maintaining production rates – just very recently, Baghdad lowered the production plateau target of its largest oil field Rumaila to 1.7 million b/d from 2.1 million b/d. Whilst the root cause of the downgrade lies in the project operators’ inability to maintain adequate water injection rates, it would not necessarily mean lower production in the now – the upgraded capacity ought to have served as Iraq’s spare capacity. 
 Chart 6. Iranian Official Selling Prices for Asia-bound cargoes (vs Oman/Dubai average). Source: NIOC. The Iranian national oil company NIOC increased its August formula prices going into Asia-Pacific by $0.50-$2.80 per barrel, effectively copying the changes made by Saudi Aramco. The $2.80 per barrel month-on-month increase of Iran Light (now at a premium of $8.90 per barrel) is a replica of pricing changes made to its peer Arab Light, keeping the spread between the two at $0.4 per barrel. However, as hard as NIOC might try, its formula prices are becoming increasingly academic – the arrival of Russian Urals into India and China have saturated the Asian crude market even further. According to media reports, the main export grade of the country, Iran Light, used to trade at a $5 per barrel discount to Oman/Dubai, however, now that there is more immediate competition around and the US continues to slap new rounds of sanctions on Iranian exports, the discounts provided by NIOC have doubled to double-digit figures on a per barrel basis.  Chart 7. Kuwaiti Super Light Official Selling Prices for Asian cargoes (vs Oman/Dubai average). Source: KPC. Kuwait’s state-owned oil company KPC has hiked the August-loading OSP of its flagship medium sour grade KEB by $1 per barrel, setting it at a $7.15 per barrel premium to Oman/Dubai. This is entirely in line with Saudi Aramco’s pricing of Arab Medium, the immediate peer of the Kuwait Export crude. Whilst the self-reported production figures coming from OPEC+ countries might raise a couple of eyebrows in terms of their correctness, Kuwait has been one of the two countries that have reportedly overproduced their June 2022 quota, churning out 2.73 million b/d on the back of a 2.72 million b/d target (the other overproducer is the UAE). Kuwaiti media reports have been focusing on soaring upstream costs in the Middle Eastern country, with average production costs almost doubling over the past decade, from $4.9 per barrel in 2012 to $8.5 per barrel right now. "
Will Russia Cut Natural Gas Flows To Europe.html,"Despite the fact that Nord Stream last week resumed operations after a 10-day maintenance period, analysts and European countries are bracing for further disruptions amid continued uncertainty about how much gas Russia will send via the pipeline to Germany.   Russia restarted gas supply via Nord Stream on Thursday, with flows resuming at around 40% of Nord Stream’s capacity, the level from before the maintenance after Russia slashed flows in June.  “Further disruptions are expected as Russia seeks to increase political and economic pressure on Europe as winter approaches,” Penny Leake, Research Analyst for Europe Gas and LNG at Wood Mackenzie, said, commenting on the restart of the Nord Stream pipeline.   “It remains unclear what Russia will do. There is a risk that Nord Stream flows will reduce below the 40% capacity seen before the maintenance,” Leake added.
 As of Monday, flows on the pipeline remained stable at around 40%, according to pipeline operators’ data cited by Reuters. But this could change as soon as Tuesday because Russia says it is due to send another turbine from a compressor station for maintenance.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Gazprom could cut natural gas flows to Europe via Nord Stream even more due to slow progress with the maintenance of the gas turbines at compressor stations. Another gas turbine is scheduled to be sent for maintenance on July 26, Putin said last Wednesday.  Related: U.S. Oil Rig Count Unchanged As WTI Slumps Below $100 On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the turbine Siemens returned would be installed once all formalities are completed, but noted, ""We know that we have issues with other turbines, too, and Siemens is well aware of this.”
 If Nord Stream flows remain at around 40% capacity, the EU could be able to fill its gas storage to over 80% by November, WoodMac analysts say.  But if Nord Stream flows reduce to zero by August this year, Europe will only be able to refill its storage to 70-75% by the start of winter, risking some demand curtailments and deficient levels of gas in storage when winter ends. In case of a very cold winter in Europe and Asia, Europe could run out of gas in storage by February 2023, risking curtailment of 7% of total gas demand or 30-35% of all industrial demand in winter, Wood Mackenzie said. "
US SPR Releases Set To End This Fall.html,"The record-high release of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve will end as scheduled this fall, the White House's Special Presidential Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein told Yahoo Finance. ""We can't be an oil supplier. It's a reserve and so we have to keep that,"" Hochstein said, adding that he did not expect this to lead to price spikes because the oil industry was already preparing to increase production once the SPR release ended. ""There's a little bit of hysteria at the moment in the analysis of oil markets,"" Hochstein said, adding that he had had conversations with oil companies and had their word they would increase production to replace the oil that is currently coming out of the SPR.
 The plan, announced in April, saw a total of 180 million barrels of crude being released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to counter the inexorable increase in oil prices amid a tight market, at a rate of some 1 million bpd. Some of that oil reportedly ended up getting exported, including to China, which prompted some When the plan was announced, there were warnings that it could backfire, pushing prices higher instead of lower because the SPR would need to be replenished after this substantial draw. Currently, oil prices—and gasoline prices in the U.S.—are down, but this has less to do with the SPR release than with worry that the Fed will hike rates again and more sharply, which could in turn lead to a slowdown in economic growth. The supply environment remains tight.
 This might change, however, according to Hochstein, who told Yahoo Finance that several oil industry CEOs had assured him that they will be boosting production by a combined 800,000 bpd to 1 million bpd by the end of the year."
US Oil Rig Count Unchanged As WTI Slumps Below 100.html,"The number of total active drilling rigs in the United States rose by 2 this week, according to new data from Baker Hughes published on Friday. The total rig count rose to 758 this week—267 rigs higher than the rig count this time in 2021. Oil rigs in the United States were unchanged this week at 599. Gas rigs rose by 2, to 155. Miscellaneous rigs stayed the same at 4.
 The rig count in the Permian Basin fell by 1 to 349 this week. Rigs in the Eagle Ford increased by 1 to 70. Oil and gas rigs in the Permian are 107 above where they were this time last year. Primary Vision's Frac Spread Count, an estimate of the number of crews completing unfinished wells—a more frugal use of finances than drilling new wells—slipped to 279 for week ending July 15, compared to 242 a year ago. Crude oil production in the United States slipped to 11.9 million bpd in the week ending July 15, down 100,000 bpd from the week prior.
 At 10:00 a.m. ET, oil prices were trending up on the day, but still down slightly on the week as recession fears continue to trump the Russia factor. WTI was trading at $96.53—up $0.18 per barrel (+0.19%) on the day, but down just over $1 per barrel on the week. The Brent benchmark traded at $104.50 per barrel, up $0.65 (+0.63%) on the day, and up roughly $3 on the week. At 1:06 pm ET, WTI was trading at $96.70, while Brent was trading at $104.80 per barrel—both up on the day."
High Crude Prices Are Here To Stay.html,"Crude oil has been on a decline over the past few weeks as growing worry about a looming global recession weighs it down. But oil is not going as far down as drivers across the world would like it to go—or as far as politicians up for reelection would like it to go. Barring a dramatic event of demand destruction, oil is going to remain expensive for the observable future. OPEC and its precious spare capacity The oil-producing cartel has repeatedly signaled that it is in no rush to deploy its spare capacity to boost global supply and bring down prices. One reason for this is the prices themselves: Saudi Arabia has been raising its oil prices for Asian buyers for several months in a row now because it can. The other reason is that spare capacity is limited. Earlier this week, when it released its latest Monthly Oil Market Report, OPEC warned that global oil demand is set to rise to levels that would test its production capacity. Known as the “call on OPEC crude,” the amount of oil that the cartel needs to produce in order to cover global demand could rise to 32 million barrels daily in 2023, OPEC said.  That would be up from 28.7 million bpd as of this June, which means OPEC would need to boost its production by over 3 million bpd within the next year and a half to cover demand, coming mostly from China and India. And it may not have the spare capacity to do it. Indeed, Reuters earlier this year cited analysts warning that this spare capacity could slip below 1 million bpd by the end of 2022.  Related: Record Profits Could Convince Oil Majors To Hike Dividends Not everyone agrees with OPEC’s demand forecast, of course. Energy Aspects, for instance, sees oil demand in 2023 at 101.8 million barrels daily, quite far below OPEC’s 103 million barrels daily. But even with demand at 101.8 million bpd, Energy Aspects’ Amrita Sen told the FT, “The market is incredibly tight and we do not think Opec have the capacity to deliver that.”
 U.S. shale continues cautiously While analysts discuss OPEC’s spare production capacity, in the United States, shale drillers continue their cautious approach to production growth amid continued calls from the White House to do just that. Since these calls have notably included a caveat that the energy transition remains priority number one, the industry has been in no rush to respond. According to the latest EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report, total oil production in the week to July 15 averaged an estimated 11.9 million bpd, which was a decline of 100,000 bpd from the previous week. It was, however, an increase from a year ago, when production averaged 11.4 million bpd. The four-week average until July 15 was 12.025 million bpd. This is quite a solid increase on the year but not a solid enough increase against the background of demand. The White House has accused the industry of profiteering from high oil prices in a tight supply environment. The industry has countered that it is suffering various challenges, such as material and equipment shortages, and inflation has not been a stranger to the oil industry, either. Frac sand prices, for instance, had soared by 185 percent over the 12 months to March this year to some $40-$45 per ton. Steel prices have risen, too, and so have wages for oilfield workers amid a labor shortage. As a result, many shale drillers have turned to re-fracs to boost production.  Related: Saudi Arabia Has Big Plans To Boost Oil Export Capacity Re-fracs, as the name suggests, refers to secondary fracking of an existing well to suck out the remaining crude at a much lower cost than drilling a new well. This counters accusations of profiteering, but it doesn’t help boost production faster.
 Investor pressure remains Meanwhile, pressure from investors remains substantial on the public players in the U.S. oil field and not just there. Big Oil is a special target for investor pressure. And it’s not just pressure to keep returning cash after years of burning it while pumping as much as possible until prices crashed. It’s pressure to signal more climate-related responsibility. Shale drillers need to make more ambitious climate commitments, investment firm Kimmeridge Energy Investments said this week, as quoted by Bloomberg. In a white paper, the firm argued that the U.S. shale oil industry should seek to bring its net carbon footprint to zero by 2030. It should also provide consistent data in this respect to make it easier for investors to pick the best companies to invest in. “We have a carbon problem, not an oil and gas problem,” Ben Dell, co-founder and managing partner of Kimmeridge, told Bloomberg in an interview. “If we can get our oil and gas product to have no carbon footprint on a net basis, and debate how you measure it and the merits, then there’s no reason we shouldn’t use it.” Between OPEC’s shrinking production capacity, the U.S. shale labor shortage, and investors’ insistence on emission reporting and net-zero commitments, it’s not hard to see where oil prices are going, even if sanctions against Russia suddenly drop, which is not happening, even if the war in Ukraine ends, as multiple EU officials have said."
Guyana Poised To Break 1 Billion In Oil And Gas Revenue This Year.html,"As the burgeoning Guyanese offshore oil and gas industry goes from strength to strength, powered by the Stabroek block, government revenue from domestic production is on track to break the $1 billion mark this year and accelerate to $7.5 billion annually in 2030, according to Rystad Energy research. This year is set to be a turning point for the Georgetown government to start capitalizing on the vast reserves in the offshore field, with revenues more than doubling over 2021 levels.  Low breakevens and below-average emissions intensity in the Stabroek will propel Guyana from a relatively small producer to a global leader in the coming years, solidifying the country’s position as a competitive and policy-friendly player for offshore production.  The government’s take* from the production is expected to increase until 2025, reaching $4.2 billion annually. Triggered by a forecasted drop in oil prices and continued spending on the field’s development, government revenues will fall to $2.4 billion in 2027. Still, production growth is set to accelerate, with revenue momentum resuming as new pre-Final Investment Decision (FID) projects are sanctioned and brought online, leading to peak government revenues of $16 billion in 2036. These projections do not factor in as-yet undiscovered resources.  The recent spate of prolific discoveries and the steady pace of FIDs position the Guyanese government to reap the rewards of these finds with cumulative revenues totaling $157 billion by 2040.  Guyana is the global leader in total offshore discoveries since 2015, with 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, amounting to 18% of discovered resources and 32% of discovered oil. Of the total, a whopping 9.6 billion barrels are oil, far outpacing the US in second place with a comparatively small 2.8 billion barrels. The Stabroek block accounts for all of these finds, but recent discoveries in other areas show the potential for growth elsewhere.   Guyana is forecasted to produce 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil by 2035 – not accounting for as-yet undiscovered volumes – propelling the country to the fourth position on the list of the largest global offshore oil producers, leapfrogging the US, Mexico and Norway.
 “Guyana is just starting to extract and monetize its vast resource wealth, and the coming years will be a financial windfall for the Georgetown government. The country has played the long game after several decades of elusive exploration. The country’s offshore production is finally ready to take off,” says Schreiner Parker, senior vice president and head of Latin America and the Caribbean.  Comparing the fiscal regimes of other offshore leaders, Guyana’s is on the higher end, with the government take clocking in at 59% of total value. In contrast, applying the US fiscal regime to the Stabroek block would result in a government take of only 40%. Nigeria and Brazil align more with Guyana’s fiscal policies, with 58% and 61%, respectively.   Related: Carbon Emissions On Track To Reach An All-Time High The cost of supply is a significant factor in considering the desirability of assets and comparing them to other sources and regions. Helping to transform Guyana into a global heavyweight in offshore production is its competitive breakeven costs, which average $28 per barrel across all projects and less than $20 for producing projects. Guyana’s offshore oil fields are some of the most competitive supply sources outside of the Middle East and offshore Norway and are cheaper than the US onshore heavyweight the Permian, Russia and many other sources.   In addition, emissions intensity from offshore activity in Guyana is lower than the global average for oil and gas production and deepwater offshore production, further strengthening the country’s position through the energy transition. Upstream emissions from Guyana’s deepwater activities average 9 kilograms of CO2 per boe, comparable to Brazil and slightly higher than Norway. 
 Although tensions with neighboring Venezuela and Suriname have been an issue in the past, warming relations have allowed for increased drilling along the borders and boosted overall investor sentiment in Guyana.   Still, it may not be all plain sailing. Strong institutional governance, transparency and regulatory practices will be vital to unlocking the full potential of Guyana’s resource wealth for its society. Although the government has taken steps to improve governance, including establishing a sovereign wealth fund and improving fiscal policy transparency, there are still improvements to be made. For instance, the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which champions strong resource management and governance practices, recently found several weaknesses in Guyana’s company reporting and tax processes. However, their EITI score will likely grow in the coming years as recent improvements take effect.  *Government take refers to the value received by the government over the life of a license in the form of royalties, profit sharing and taxes. "
Worlds Top Oilfield Service Provider Raises Earnings Outlook.html,"Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) reported on Friday higher-than-expected profit for the second quarter as drilling activity rebounded in all markets, prompting the world’s largest oilfield service provider to raise its 2022 revenue and earnings outlook as “the multiyear upcycle continues to gain momentum.”    Schlumberger booked earnings per share (EPS), excluding charges and credits, of $0.50 for the second quarter, up by 47% sequentially and 67% year on year. This past quarter’s EPS were higher than the $0.40 EPS average analyst estimate compiled by The Wall Street Journal. Schlumberger’s shares rose by 2.26% pre-market after the higher-than-expected earnings and revenue and the raised outlook for the full year.  For Q2, Schlumberger reported revenues of $6.8 billion, up by 14% sequentially and 20% year on year.  “As a result of this performance and based on our updated outlook for the remainder of the year, 2022 year-on-year revenue growth is now expected to be in the high-teens which translates to full-year revenue of at least $27 billion,” Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch said. 
 “We expect this higher revenue to result in earnings that exceed our previous expectations, given our ambition to exit the year with adjusted EBITDA margins 200 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter of 2021,” Le Peuch added.  “The multiyear upcycle continues to gain momentum with upstream activity and service pricing steadily increasing both internationally and in North America, resulting in a strengthened outlook for Schlumberger,” the executive said.  Related: The Commodities To Benefit From China’s Stimulus Plan Commenting on the oil market and drilling activity prospects, Le Peuch said, “Despite near-term concerns over a global economic slowdown, the combination of energy security, favorable break-even prices, and the urgency to grow oil and gas production capacity is expected to continue to support strong upstream E&P spending growth. Consequently, we are witnessing a decoupling of upstream spending from near-term demand volatility, resulting in resilient global oil and gas activity growth in 2022 and beyond.” 
 Schlumberger was the last of the three biggest oilfield service providers reporting Q2 earnings. Earlier this week, Baker Hughes (NASDAQ: BKR) flagged “mixed results” due to supply-chain inflation and revenue losses from the suspension of its operations in Russia. Baker Hughes sees the oil market facing “an unusual set of circumstances and challenges” for the rest of this year and into next year, Baker Hughes chairman and CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said.  Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) opened the oil and gas industry’s earnings season on Tuesday, reporting a 41-percent surge in its second-quarter adjusted net income amid growing drilling activity both in North America and in international markets, and saying it expects international markets to see “multiple years of growth.”   "
Putin Calls Saudi Crown Prince To Discuss Oil Market OPEC.html,"Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone conversation with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the oil market and OPEC+. The two parties also made a note of the importance of collaboration within OPEC+, adding that OPEC+ members have consistently fulfilled their obligations to maintain market balance and stability in the energy markets. OPEC+ has consistently failed to meet its production targets over the duration of the deal. In June, OPEC+--a group that includes both Russia and Saudi Arabia—increased its oil production by 390,000 bpd, but most members failed to meet their production targets. OPEC’s share of the increase for June was 210,000 bpd, while non-OPEC members part of the OPEC+ group increased production by 180,000 bpd, according to a recent Platts survey.
 Overall, this was still more than 2.5 million bpd under the quota for the full OPEC+ group. Russia and Saudi Arabia—the two largest producers within OPEC+--saw the biggest production gains in June. While the group has fallen short of production targets, OPEC continues to insist that the market is in balance. Saudi Arabia has long maintained that it can do nothing beyond what it is already doing to help the oil market, and that the market is far more complex than merely pumping additional barrels of oil.
 That hasn’t stopped President Joe Biden from repeatedly asking the group to increase its oil production to alleviate the high pump prices in the United States. While U.S. gasoline prices have eased over the last month to $4.44, they remain $1.278 above last year’s levels, according to AAA data. The phone call is just the latest in a series of calls between Saudi Arabia and Russia, even after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine."
The Middle East Oil Bonanza Will Slow In 2023.html,"Slowing global oil demand growth next year, spiking food prices, and fears of recession in major oil-importing countries are set to slow economic growth in the Middle East, whose major oil producers are enjoying this year a windfall of oil revenues and the highest growth in years.    Economies in the Arab Gulf states that are part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—are on track for the fastest economic growth in years and for budget surpluses, for some of them the first surpluses in a decade. Growth in the GCC is expected at 6.2% this year, according to a Reuters poll of economists who revised up their 5.9% economic growth forecast from a similar poll in April.   However, growth will slow down next year, to 3.8% across the GCC, the economists reckon.   “A broadening or worsening of the war in Ukraine could tip the global economy into recession, pushing oil prices down sharply even if oil supply remains constrained, hitting regional growth and fiscal balances,” Ensaf Al-Matrouk, assistant economist at NBK, told Reuters.  $100 Oil Is A Boon To Middle East’s Oil Exporters  Triple-digit oil prices have accelerated economic growth in the major Middle Eastern oil exporters, including the world’s largest crude oil exporter, Saudi Arabia. Oil revenues are soaring, fiscal balances are strong, and growth – fueled by higher oil prices and higher oil production as OPEC+ rolls back the output cuts – is being revised up. Moreover, inflation is not as high in Middle Eastern oil exporters as it is in the United States and Europe, which protects the Gulf economies to some extent from global inflationary pressures.     The Saudi economy, for example, is set for stronger performance this year than previously expected amid high oil prices, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in April, revising its growth forecast to 7.6% for 2022, up by 2.8 percentage points from the previous estimate.
  Related: U.S. Hopes For Price Cap On Russian Oil By Year-End For the first quarter alone, Saudi Arabia’s economy grew by 9.9% annually, the highest growth rate since 2011, the General Authority for Statistics says, attributing the growth to the “high increase in oil activities,” which surged by 20.3% year over year. Moreover, Saudi Arabia booked a budget surplus of $15.3 billion (57.491 billion Saudi riyals) in the first quarter, the ministry of finance said in May. Oil revenues soared by 58 percent to $49 billion (183.7 billion Saudi riyals) between January and March, when oil prices surged to above $100 a barrel, the finance ministry data showed.  For the whole of 2022, the Saudi economy is set to grow by 7.6%, the fastest growth pace in more than a decade, according to the Reuters poll. This is in line with the IMF projection from April.  Slowdown in 2023 Next year, however, the pace of growth in Saudi Arabia and the GCC is set to halve, with 3.8% growth expected for the GCC countries and 3.3% for Saudi Arabia by the Reuters poll. The IMF also predicts slower growth in Saudi Arabia next year, at 3.6%.  If recession fears in Europe or the U.S. materialize, economic growth in the Middle East could be even slower as a recession would curb global oil demand growth or could even lead to a decline in consumption year over year. The Gulf economies, dependent on oil revenues, would feel the sting of potentially lower demand and lower oil prices once again.  That’s why the IMF and other major economic forecasters and bodies have been advising Saudi Arabia and all of the Middle Eastern oil and gas exporters for years to speed up the diversification of economies and not to rely on the cyclical nature of the oil windfall.  
 “Fiscal policy should focus on managing the higher oil revenue gains sustainably,” the IMF said last month about the Saudi economy. Much lower inflation in Saudi Arabia and other major oil exporters than the largest jump in consumer prices in 40 years in the U.S. and many countries in Europe is a good thing for the Middle East economies now, analysts say. In Saudi Arabia, headline inflation is set to accelerate in the second half of 2022, but will remain contained at 2.8 percent on average in 2022 as an appreciating U.S. dollar to which the Saudi riyal is pegged, caps on gasoline prices, and subsidies on wheat help contain pressure from supply-side shocks, the IMF said in June.  Despite slower expected growth next year, the sovereign outlook on the Middle East remains at “improving,” per Fitch Ratings’ latest outlook. The rating agency revised the global sovereign credit conditions to “neutral” from “improving,” due to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and consequent sanctions on geopolitical risk, trade and capital flows, and economic growth and inflation.  “The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is the only region to maintain its improving sector outlook assigned at end-2021. Oil-exporting sovereigns will register significantly stronger public finances and growth in 2022, although the economic picture will be much more challenging outside the Gulf Cooperation Council,” Fitch Ratings said at the end of last month.   "
Saudi Arabias Ability To Pump More Oil Limited.html,"Saudi Arabia has limited additional crude oil production capacity, Wall Street Journal sources revealed on Wednesday. The sources, who are said to be familiar with Saudi Arabia’s oil production capabilities, were not named.
 The mystery surrounding Saudi Arabia’s crude production capabilities has grown in recent weeks amid a tight oil market, Europe’s energy crisis, and the United States’ battle with high retail gasoline prices. Large oil producers such as Saudi Arabia—thought to be one of the only possible swing producers left within OPEC—try to maintain at least some spare capacity that can be turned on to respond to market demands, providing those producers with greater market control. Alternatively, the market is spooked by a lack of spare capacity—particularly of OPEC’s largest producer—adding more volatility to already volatile oil prices. That fear exists even if that spare capacity is not needed now, simply because it means that should demand increase or supply elsewhere falter, they would be unable to respond to the changing market conditions.
 U.S. President Joe Biden just returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia. Upon his return, the President said that he expected Saudi Arabia to boost oil production. Saudi Arabia, however, is bound by the production quota that it agreed to with OPEC+, at least until the end of August. Under that deal, Saudi Arabia’s production quota will be lifted to 11.004 million bpd for that month. After that, Saudi Arabia would be free to produce as much crude oil as it would like, limited only by its willingness to do so and its spare capacity. Today is not the first time that concerns have been raised that Saudi Arabia’s true spare capacity is quite thin. For June, Saudi Arabia produced 10.424 million bpd, an increase of 60,000 bpd from the month prior. Its allocated quota for the month of June was 10.662—a miss of 238,000 bpd. Its under production lends credence to the notion that Saudi Arabia might not have as much spare capacity as some think."
Russias Cheap Oil Gains Market Share In China.html,"China continues to buy discounted Russian crude and is gobbling up the ESPO crude grade from Russia’s Far East, upending global trade flows. ESPO, which Russia ships from its Far Eastern ports, is being offered at a 10-percent discount compared to similar-quality crudes from Brazil or West Africa, traders familiar with the Chinese buying told Bloomberg on Wednesday.   ESPO goes for around $1-$2 discount per barrel to the international benchmark Brent, while Brazil’s Lula and Sapinhoa crudes, for example, are being offered at a $10 per barrel premium over Brent, the traders told Bloomberg.
 The high demand for the cheaper Russian crude relative to rival grades has already reduced Chinese imports from West Africa, and even forced Iran to additionally discount its crude going to China—pretty much the only current buyer of Iranian oil, which continues to be under U.S. sanctions. ESPO is also attractive in China because shipment from Russia’s Far Eastern port of Kozmino takes around four days, compared to two months for a cargo delivery from Brazil. ESPO is among the favorite blends of China’s independent refiners, the so-called teapots, and they have lifted a lot of that grade over the past weeks, traders told Bloomberg.  
 The high Chinese demand for cheaper Russian crude was evident in the Chinese customs data released on Wednesday, which showed that Russia remained China’s top oil supplier ahead of Saudi Arabia for a second month running, while Saudi oil imports slumped. In June, China imported around 1.77 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil, below the previous month’s record, but still way ahead of shipments from Saudi Arabia, according to the customs data cited by Reuters. Chinese oil imports from Saudi Arabia slumped to 1.23 million bpd, from 1.84 million bpd in May, and were 30% below the June 2021 imports. In May, China imported a record volume of Russian crude, with arrivals surging by 55 percent to nearly 2 million bpd. This made Russia the top oil supplier to the world’s leading crude importer—putting it ahead of Saudi Arabia for the first time in a year and a half."
How China Could Trigger The Next Sharp Selloff In Crude.html,
Libyas Oil Crisis Is Far From Over.html,"  For a moment last week, it seemed that Libya might be snapping back into some version of itself more approaching normalcy than has been evident for some time. There was news from local sources that the country’s state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) had lifted the force majeure on the eastern oil terminals of Zueitina and Brega that had been in place on and off for weeks. This move was made specifically to allow an oil tanker ship to carry condensate for use in power generation in the country, but the expectations were that it would presage a broader opening of Libya’s oil export infrastructure. Such force majeures and other associated shutdowns and blockades have resulted in Libya producing just 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in June, its lowest level since October 2020. This message of optimism was one conveyed also by NOC chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, last week. And yet, within the space of just a few hours, Libya had returned to its usual state of extreme nervous tension, with all the reliability and trustworthiness as a global oil supplier of a puff adder on Benzedrine. Functioning more every day as a twisted parody of the failed state that the casual removal in 2011 by the West of its long-time leader, Muammar Gaddafi, made it, Libya appears now to have lost Sanalla himself as the chairman of the NOC, with all the additional chaos that this may spark. According to several local news reports, the Government of National Unity of Prime Minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, has replaced Sanalla as the chairman of the NOC with his long-time associate, Farhat Bengdara, who was governor of the Central Bank of Libya from 2006 to 2011. Sanalla, highly respected by several international oil companies (IOCs) for keeping much of Libya’s oil production flowing despite extreme political pressures from all sides in the ongoing civil conflict, has rejected Prime Minister Dbeibah’s authority to sack him. Additionally, in a fiery television appearance, Sanalla – who has received backing from both of Libya’s opposing legislative bodies - warned Dbeibah not to touch the NOC or the oil revenues and contracts that it manages. Bengdara then held his own news conference at the NOC headquarters building and received the backing of two major NOC affiliate companies - Al Waha Oil, and Arabian Gulf Oil - before Al Waha then deleted its message of support.   Related: EU Considers Mandatory Gas Rationing All of this follows the very recent failed attempt by Fathi Bashagha – appointed prime minister of the ‘alternative government’ in the east of the country three months ago – to seize power in Tripoli. Bashagha, and the Nawasi Brigade militia who accompanied him, were eventually driven out of the city by various of the many factions fighting there. This occurred amid the ongoing refusal of the Dbeibah - who was appointed through a United Nations (U.N.)-led process in 2021 - to hand over power until such a time as a properly elected government is voted into office by the people of Libya. Bashagha, who has led three such coup attempts in three months, is unlikely to stop his current attempts to seize power, given the distinct possibility that recent talks held in Egypt at the behest of U.N. envoy Stephanie Williams to reach an agreement on a new constitutional framework and a timeline for elections might see him side-lined. 
 Since the removal of long-time leader Gaddafi, in 2011, as analysed in depth in my new book on the global oil markets, the multi-factional civil conflict that has ensued found genuine relief only in the September 2020 agreement signed between Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the rebel Libyan National Army (LNA) and elements of Tripoli’s U.N.-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). However, even back then, a key part of this deal was an in-principle agreement to look into establishing a commission not only to determine how oil revenues across Libya are distributed but also to consider the implementation of a number of measures designed to stabilise the country’s perilous financial position. Just prior to the September 2020 agreement, there had been yet another series of long-running oil blockades that had cost the country an estimated US$9.8 billion in lost hydrocarbons revenues.  Both before this 2020 agreement and after it began to break down, Libya’s oil sector has been subject to various-scale blockades of its key oil facilities, and the NOC had also declared a legal state of ‘force majeure’ because “it is impossible to implement its commitments towards the oil market.” Libyan crude oil production had seen the extended loss of around 550,000 bpd of its oil production because of these blockades on major fields and export terminals, which included the closure of the Zueitina port, whose crude loadings average around 90,000 bpd, with production also stopped at Abuatufol, Al-Intisar, Anakhla, and Nafura. Just prior to this, the Sharara field in the west of the country, which can pump around 300,000 bpd, was also shut down and just prior to this the El Feel oil field, which produces 70,000 bpd, was closed, as was the 60,000 bpd Brega operation. These sites are key suppliers of mostly high-quality light, sweet crude oil, notably including the Es Sider and Sharara export crudes that are particularly in demand in the Mediterranean and Northwest Europe for their gasoline and middle distillate yields. Before Gaddafi’s removal in 2011, Libya had been easily able to produce around 1.65 million bpd of mostly high-quality light, sweet crude oil and production had been on a rising production trajectory, up from about 1.4 million bpd in 2000, albeit well below the peak levels of more than 3 million bpd achieved in the late 1960s. This said, the NOC had plans in place before 2011 to roll out enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques to increase crude oil production at maturing oil fields. Even up until the most recent major production blockades of its western fields ended and eastern ports, Libya had been producing around 1.2 million bpd. From that level, there still appeared ample scope to increase this to the 2.1 million bpd targeted by Libya’s minister of gas and oil, Mohamed Aoun, and to hit the informal interim targets of 1.45 million bpd by the end of 2022, and 1.6 million bpd by the end of 2023. It is apposite to remember at this point that Libya still has around 48 billion barrels of proved crude oil reserves – the largest in Africa. 
 A considerable part of the reason for Sanalla’s dismissal by Dbeibah may have been to do with his ongoing disagreements with oil and gas minister Aoun, but this in turn is tied into the ongoing failure of all parties to agree on any meaningful handling of the country’s oil and gas revenues. At the core of Libya’s short-, medium-, and long-term crude oil production outlook, and again reiterated behind the scenes in the recent Cairo talks initiated by the U.S., is that there must be genuine progress on the issue of fair distribution of oil revenues, the promise of which had successfully underpinned the 2020 agreement for longer than anyone expected. According to a Washington-based legal source spoken to by OilPrice.com at the time of the September 2020 agreement and reiterated recently, the NOC had been working on “alternative banking arrangements for the oil revenues that may or may not involve the input on final dispersal of more players.”  Part of this process would be the creation of technical committees with representatives drawn from all sides of the civil conflict. These separate committees would deal with field awards, in tandem with the oil and gas ministry, and the dispersal of oil and gas revenues, in tandem with the ministry and the Central Bank of Libya (in which the revenues are physically held). As it stands, neither the GNA nor the Central Bank of Libya have publicly and unequivocally agreed to its core principles as yet. Indeed, during the last major series of blockades of Libya’s oil infrastructure, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, urged the country’s central bank to safeguard oil revenue from misappropriation. Bengdara said last week that any challenge to his leadership of the NOC should be made via the courts, but parliament stated that Sanalla’s position and his board remained valid, while the other legislative body, the Tripoli-based High State Council, called on Dbeibah to revoke the decision to install a new NOC head. Bengdara also said that there would be “good news next week” on returning oil exports to their maximum level, it remains unclear how true or long-lasting this might be, given the ongoing turmoil over the leadership of the NOC. "
Libya To Resume Oil Exports After Lifting Force Majeure.html,"Libya will begin loading oil for export on July 20 after the force majeure was declared lifted following an intense battle for control of the National Oil Company (NOC) last week.  The Government of National Unity (GNU), led by interim prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, last week appointed a new chairman of the NOC to replace long-time chairman Mustafa Sanalla, who refused to step down when armed militias stormed the headquarters.  After days of silence on the NOC website and social media pages, late on Monday, a statement released on the NOC Facebook page said that two tankers would arrive at the ports of Zueitina and Sidra to load more than one million barrels of oil. The statement also said that an additional two tankers would arrive at the port of Ras Lanuf, either on the 20th or 21st. 
 “These arrangements have been made in order to resume production operations,” NOC added. Farhat Bengdara (bin Qadara) on Sunday said he had officially taken over the NOC and announced that the oil blockade would be lifted within a week after holding talks with powerbrokers in the ‘Oil Crescent’ region.  Sanalla remains silent, and talk now is of some sort of alliance-shifting deal between General Khalifa Haftar, the head of the Libyan National Army (LNA) who had supported Dbeibah’s rival, Fathi Bashagha. 
 Bashagha was appointed new prime minister in March by the country’s eastern-backed Parliament, while Dbeibah, whose mandate technically ended when his government failed to hold elections in December last year, has refused to step down. As of June 30th, Libya was exporting between 365,000 and 409,000 barrels per day. Prior to the declaration of force majeure in April, the country was exporting up to 865,000 bpd, according to NOC data cited by S&P Platts. "
Are OPEC And The IEA Right About Whats Next For Oil.html,"Both OPEC and the International Energy Agency are predicting next year’s market to be one of the tightest in recent history. According to a Financial Times post, the two bodies have based this assumption on recovering demand in China and continued growth in India. The prediction also runs counter to widespread fears of recession. With oil prices currently declining from record highs, it can be difficult to predict where the market will go next. However, as Investing.com reports, it’s not that the IEA is completely ignoring those recession fears. In fact, the organization has reduced its expected increase in demand for next year specifically because of recessionary forces. That said, they are still predicting an increase in demand of 2.1M b/d – down from 2.2M b/d estimated last month. Still, after 2022’s surge in oil prices, is it even possible to determine where demand will go from here? Well, in its first forecast for 2023, OPEC said it expected average demand to rise by 2.7  million barrels a day next year. This would put estimates at roughly 103mn b/d total. The forecast is based heavily on increased economic activity and even makes light of fears that a recession would crush demand. At the same time, oil production from non-OPEC countries is only expected to grow by 1.7mn b/d. This will place a heavy burden on OPEC’s 13 members, some of which (notably Nigeria and Angola) are already struggling to meet current output targets. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is already committed to pumping 11mn b/d by August – a level of production it has never sustained for a prolonged period.

 To add uncertainty to the situation, the FT stated that OPEC’s analysis might not properly account for Russia. In fact, it assumes that, despite the war in Ukraine, Russian oil output will only decrease by 200,000 b/d in 2023 to 10.4mn b/d. This is a highly uncertain figure, to put it mildly. So, to bridge the gap between supply and demand, the FT states OPEC would therefore have to pump an average of 30.1mn b/d during the year. This, according to the cartel’s own estimate. But seasonal variations in demand mean the call on OPEC crude would reach as much as 32mn b/d in the last three months of the year. That is approximately 3.3mn b/d more than the 28.7mn b/d OPEC’s members produced in June.  Related: U.S. Rig Count Rises Despite Chaotic Week In Oil Markets However, not everyone is quite so bullish. For instance, oilprice.com reported this week how widespread recession fears are affecting investment. The article states that hedge fund and other money managers have been quitting their oil positions at one of the fastest rates in the post-pandemic period. Indeed, they sold a total of 201 million barrels in the past four weeks. That current market view has resulted in sharp falls this week. This has left the WTI down more than 7% to below $96.50 and left Brent hovering around $100.
 It’s important to note that fears of ongoing disruption in China are not constrained to oil. This past week, COVID-triggered lockdowns resulted in iron ore prices plunging on concerns of weakening Chinese demand. Many traders were shocked to see the front-month Dalian contract lose 4% in one day, dropping to just $110/mt. So who is your money on? On the one hand, you have OPEC and the IEA’s optimistic view of constrained supply and rising demand. On the other hand, you have the prevailing market view. It states that recessionary pressures in the West and further lockdown-related disruption in China will hamper recovery and drastically reduce demand. Both could be correct, of course. Perhaps the former will describe the long term while the latter describes the short term? In the end, a lot will depend on whether or not a recession takes place and its overall severity. We also have to consider China’s recovery after the October re-election of President Xi, and Russia’s ability to continue to pump and find markets for its oil. There are too many moving pieces to call it at the moment and too much potential for volatility. Ultimately, the best advice is for exposed consumers to lock in profits whenever they can."
Keystone Force Majeure Cuts Oil Flows To US.html,"TC Energy, the operator of the Keystone Pipeline, declared force majeure on Monday following a power outage in South Dakota, which reduced the flows on the link carrying crude from Canada to the U.S. TC Energy said in a statement late on Monday that it was made aware of a non-operational incident resulting from third-party damage to the power supply to a facility on the Keystone Pipeline System near Huron, South Dakota. The system continues to operate safely, but it is operating at a reduced rate due to damage to the third-party power utility. “Initial damage assessments have been completed with no material impact to TC Energy owned facilities,” the company said. As a result of the power outage, TC Energy declared force majeure on the Keystone Pipeline, but did not provide a timeline for restoring crude flows to full capacity.   
 “Repairs are being undertaken and we are working to restore full service as soon as possible. A timeline for full-service restoration is not available at this time,” the company said. The 2,687-mile Keystone Pipeline System plays a key role in connecting Alberta’s crude oil supplies to U.S. refining markets in Illinois, Oklahoma, and Texas, as well as connecting U.S. crude oil supplies from the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub to refining markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast through the Marketlink Pipeline System. The reduced flows of crude from Canada to the United States comes days after U.S. President Joe Biden returned from his trip to the Middle Eastern without receiving a specific commitment from the top OPEC producers to boost oil supply in the near term. Meanwhile, gasoline prices in the U.S. continued to fall for a fifth consecutive week, to a national average of $4.51 per gallon as of July 18, according to data compiled by fuel-savings app GasBuddy. 
 “Barring major hurricanes, outages or unexpected disruptions, I forecast the national average to fall to $3.99/gal by mid-August,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. In the past three days, South Carolina and Texas became the first two states to see state average gasoline prices return to below $4 per gallon, according to GasBuddy."
Tanker Companies Race To Ship Russian Oil Ahead Of New Sanctions.html,"Western sanctions have so far failed to crush Russia’s oil exports as Moscow is redirecting crude to its more than willing Asian buyers, China and India.  European vessel owners, especially private Greek operators, are moving a lot of the Russian oil in the months before the EU ban on seaborne Russian oil imports kicks in at the end of this year. Greek tanker owners have increased their exposure to Russian oil shipping in the past two months as they race to profit from the higher demand for heavily discounted Russian oil in China and India.  Once EU sanctions on seaborne imports of Russian oil take effect this December, Greek tanker operators will have to stop shipping Russian oil. A much bigger blow to Russian oil exports that will have dramatic consequences on the global oil tanker market and oil prices comes from provision number two in the sixth sanctions package - EU operators will be prohibited from insuring and financing the marine transportation of Russian oil to third countries.  Until the sanctions enter into force, European, especially Greek, tanker owners are moving a lot of Russian oil to Asia, making a lot of money in the process. Shippers from Greece, China, and Turkey are eagerly taking advantage of the situation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By shipping Russian ESPO crude from Kozmino to the Chinese coast, a ship owner can make $1.6 million—three times what they would have made before the war in Ukraine.   Earlier this month, Ukraine called out Greece for shipping Russian oil.  “We see Greek companies providing almost the largest tanker fleet for the transportation of Russian oil,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a speech to a conference in Athens via video link. 
 “Once again: this is happening precisely when another Russian energy resource is being used as a weapon against Europe and against the family budget of every European. I am sure that this does not meet the interests of Europe, Greece, or Ukraine,” Zelensky added.  Greek vessel owners made 151 port calls from Baltic and Black Sea Russian ports between May 1 and June 27, up by 41% compared to the same period last year, according to data compiled by Lloyd’s List using Lloyd’s List Intelligence. Almost half of all crude and refined products exported from key Baltic or Black Sea ports were shipped on vessels Greek tanker owners beneficially own, the data showed. TMS Tankers of billionaire George Economou is the biggest Greek player in the Russian market and second overall, second only to Russia-owned Sovcomflot, which is under Western sanctions, according to the data.   Related: What Does The UK’s Electricity Market Shakeup Mean For Consumers? Greek tankers are also participating in ship-to-ship (STS) transfers offshore Greece, Malta, and south of Gibraltar, Lloyd’s List data showed.  It’s difficult to predict what will happen to the global tanker market when the EU sanctions enter into force, but demand for oil remains high, so tankers will be used on other routes, a CEO at a Greek shipping firm told The Wall Street Journal. 
 “They will travel longer distances which means they will make more money,” the executive added.  “Dark” STS transfers of Russian crude, alongside shutting off vessel transponders and attempts to disguise the origin of the oil, are set to only increase as the EU sanctions approach, analysts say.  David Wech, Chief Economist at energy data provider Vortexa, wrote at the end of last month:  “The need to export crude and products in growing volumes to long-haul destinations East of Suez, ideally disguising also the origins to attract potential buyers beyond China and India, may be growing well ahead of the sixth EU sanction package coming into force around the turn of the year.”    "
Chinas Fuel Exports Plunge.html,"China’s exports of gasoline and diesel slumped in the first half of 2022, per customs data out on Monday, as Chinese authorities continued to work to reduce overseas sales of fuels and allocated lower export quotas to refiners.  Gasoline exports slumped by 42 percent annually in the first half of this year compared to the same period of 2021, according to Chinese customs data cited by Reuters. Diesel exports crumbled by an even larger percentage—they were down by 84 percent between January and July compared to the first half of 2021.    This month, China’s fuel exports are expected to rebound after the government has recently allocated a new batch of export quotas to refiners, according to industry consultancy JLC quoted by Bloomberg.
 The latest batch of export quotas has been issued, but combined with other quotas so far this year, overall export quotas from China are much lower than last year’s. At the beginning of this month, China issued the latest batch of fuel export quotas for refiners, and total quotas so far this year are 39 percent lower than the collective quotas this time last year—a sign that Chinese fuel exports are unlikely to ease the tight fuel market globally. The Chinese authorities have approved the latest batch for a total of 5 million tons, Reuters reported, citing sources. That would be enough for the refiners given quotas to make money with sales on the export market, but not enough to ease the global crunch in fuel supply.
 China started this year by considerably reducing the allowances for fuel exports in the first export quota batch for 2022, signaling its intention to limit fuel sales abroad and curb excessive refinery output. Exports were reportedly limited in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as Chinese authorities were said to have asked state refiners in the country to consider halting diesel and gasoline exports in April due to heightened concerns about oil supply. Chinese diesel and gasoline exports so far this year have been well below last year’s, while COVID-related lockdowns hurt demand in the spring, swelling domestic Chinese inventories."
Biden Advisor Sees OPEC Raising Oil Production.html,"The United States believes that OPEC’s Middle Eastern producers have room to boost production and will take “a few more steps” to boost supply to the oil market soon, according to Amos Hochstein, the special presidential coordinator for international energy affairs.   “Based on what we heard on the trip, I’m pretty confident we will see a few more steps in the coming weeks,” Hochstein said on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, after U.S. President Joe Biden and his team returned from a trip to the Middle East, where the U.S. officials met with the leaders of the top producers in OPEC—Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait. “There is additional spare capacity, there is room for increased production,” Hochstein told CBS, without elaborating how much spare capacity those producers have, if they are willing to use it, and when they might achieve a higher production level.
 President Biden returned to Washington from the Middle Eastern trip without receiving a specific commitment from the top OPEC producers to boost oil supply to the market in the near term.   President Biden commented on his meetings in Saudi Arabia, “We had a good discussion on ensuring global energy security and adequate oil supplies to support global economic growth. And that will begin shortly. And I’m doing all I can to increase the supply for the United States of America, which I expect to happen. The Saudis share that urgency, and based on our discussions today, I expect we’ll see further steps in the coming weeks.” In his Sunday interview with CBS, Hochstein said that he expects the national average gasoline price to continue dropping from around $4.50 a gallon “more towards $4 and we already have many gas stations around the country that are below $4.”
 As of July 17, the national average price of gasoline was $4.532 per gallon, down from $5.000 a month ago. Most of the decline over the past month has been due to falling crude oil prices amid recession fears and a decline in U.S. gasoline demand due to the high prices at the pump."
Saudi Arabia Reveals Oil Production Capacity Limits.html,"Saudi Arabia, the world’s top crude oil exporter, will not have additional capacity to increase production above the 13 million barrels per day (bpd) it has pledged to have by 2027, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told the leaders of the United States, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq at a summit this weekend. “We also stress the importance of continuing to inject and encourage investments in fossil energy and its clean technologies over the next two decades to meet the growing global demand, with the importance of assuring investors that the policies adopted do not pose a threat to their investments to avoid their reluctance to invest and to ensure that no shortage of energy supply would affect the international economy,” Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in his address.   
 “The Kingdom will do its part in this regard, as it announced an increase in its production capacity to 13 million barrels per day, after which the Kingdom will not have any additional capacity to increase production,” he added, as carried by the Saudi Press Agency. Last year, Saudi Arabia said it expects to have boosted its oil production capacity to 13 million bpd by 2027 from 12 million bpd now.
 Earlier this year, the Saudis confirmed this target, with Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman, telling TIME in an interview, “We are targeting our production capacity to become 13.4, 13.5 million barrels a day by 2027.” At the Jeddah summit, the Saudi crown prince also criticized the growing backlash against fossil fuels, saying that “The adoption of unrealistic policies to reduce emissions by excluding major sources of energy without taking into account the resulting impact of these policies on the social and economic pillars of sustainable development and global supply chains will lead in the coming years to unprecedented inflation, rise in energy prices, increase unemployment and exacerbate serious social and security problems, including an increase in poverty and famine and crime rates, extremism and terrorism.”  "
Biden Fails To Secure Firm Pledge From Saudis For Oil Production Boost.html,"U.S. President Joe Biden returned to Washington from a trip to the Middle East without receiving a specific commitment from the top OPEC producers to boost oil supply to the market in the very near term. President Biden visited Saudi Arabia and even met last week with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after making a U-turn in his attitude toward the Kingdom in recent months. Two years ago, President Biden described Saudi Arabia as a “pariah” state and criticized it for its track record of abuses of human rights. During meetings in Saudi Arabia and on the sidelines of an Arab summit in Jeddah over the past week, President Biden failed to secure firm pledges from the Saudis, Iraq, or the UAE—the largest producers in OPEC—for an imminent supply increase.  
 This much was expected, as multiple sources and U.S. officials told agencies last week that there would not be any public announcement on an immediate oil supply boost. Instead, the White House issued vague statements about market stability. At the end of the summit of the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the White House said, “The leaders recognized ongoing efforts of OPEC+ towards stabilizing the global oil market in the interests of consumers, producers, and supporting economic growth. They welcomed the recent announcement by OPEC+ members to increase supply over the course of July and August, and commended the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s leading role in achieving consensus between the members of OPEC+.” Referring to the meeting with Saudi Arabia’s leaders, the White House said that the United States had welcomed the increase in production levels 50 percent above what was planned for July and August. “These steps and further steps that we anticipate over the coming weeks have and will help stabilize markets considerably,” the White House added.
 President Biden commented on his meetings in Saudi Arabia, “We had a good discussion on ensuring global energy security and adequate oil supplies to support global economic growth. And that will begin shortly. And I’m doing all I can to increase the supply for the United States of America, which I expect to happen. The Saudis share that urgency, and based on our discussions today, I expect we’ll see further steps in the coming weeks.” OPEC+ are meeting on August 3 to decide how their production pact would (or would not) proceed from September onwards now that the group will have rolled back all the production cuts it implemented in May 2020."
Is This The Only Way To Curb Russian Oil Revenues.html,"The West is looking to cap the price of Russian oil with the double goal of restricting Putin’s oil revenues while lowering energy bills for the biggest oil-consuming nations, including the top oil consumer, the United States.  The success of such a plan is far from certain, but there may be one surefire way to restrict Russia’s oil revenues—a way that would also inflict pain on the West. We’re talking about a recession. For weeks, the U.S. and partners have been discussing ideas, including banning all services enabling Russian oil shipments unless buyers pay for Russia’s oil at or below a certain price. There are concerns that more restrictions on Russian seaborne oil would backfire, increasing international crude oil prices further and nullifying efforts to curb Putin’s energy revenues.  There is one scenario in which Russia will see its revenues from oil crumble. But it’s a scenario no policy maker in the West wants, and one that Putin will likely be happy about. This would be a recession in major economies, including the United States, with subsequent significant demand destruction that would drive oil prices down, reduce revenues for Russia, and even free some spare oil production capacity from what is now believed to be a record-thin cushion to absorb further shocks.  “Recession or a business cycle downturn would change the circumstances and make it possible, at least in principle, to replace Russia’s petroleum exports with more barrels from other suppliers,” Reuters market analyst John Kemp wrote in his column this week.  The markets, including the oil market, already fear that recession is a distinct possibility in the very near future as the Fed and other central banks aggressively hike interest rates in their efforts to combat the highest inflation rates in more than forty years. If a possible recession leads to sizeable demand destruction, tight market balances will loosen, and supply from other major producing regions could replace the loss of Russian barrels. 
 However, some analysts say that an inflation-driven recession may not be devastating to oil consumption globally as it could only dent the expected demand growth, not actually reduce world demand year over year.  Meanwhile, policymakers in the U.S. and its allies are scrambling for a solution to limit the most significant contribution to Vladimir Putin’s war chest—oil revenues. Despite the lowest Russian crude and oil product exports since August 2021, Moscow saw its oil export revenues rise in June, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its Oil Market Report this week.  Russia’s combined crude and product exports in June dropped by 250,000 bpd from May to 7.4 million bpd, the lowest level since August 2021. But at the same time, Russian oil export revenues increased by $700 million in June from May due to higher oil prices, to $20.4 billion, which is 40% above last year’s average, the IEA said.  The current tight market balances and higher oil prices help Russia boost its oil revenue despite a drop in exports. Shipments are likely to further decline when the EU embargo on Russian seaborne oil kicks in at the end of this year. Without measures to cap the price of Russian oil and without recession, Putin will continue raking in oil export revenues amid high oil prices.   Related: Europe’s Big And Expensive Energy Mistake
 So the price cap is now the focus of Western efforts to cut money flows to Russia and ease consumer pain at the pump.   “A price cap on Russian oil is one of our most powerful tools to address the pain that Americans and families across the world are feeling at the gas pump and the grocery store right now,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday at the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in Bali, Indonesia.  “A limit on the price of Russian oil would deny Putin revenue his war machine needs and would build on the historic sanctions we’ve already implemented to make it more difficult for him to wage his war or grow his economy,” Secretary Yellen added.   “It will also aid in maintaining the global supply of oil, helping put downward pressure on prices for consumers in America and globally at a time when energy prices are spiking,” she noted.  "
